Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring.

History\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\nSupplement on Assessment\n.\nEducational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\nFor details on this history, see the\nSupplement on History\n.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\nTransit\n: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down\non a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I\nreturned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway\nexpress. But was there a station near? If not, I might lose more than\ntwenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and\nI saw there was such a line within two blocks. But where was the\nstation? If it were several blocks above or below the street I was on,\nI should lose time instead of gaining it. My mind went back to the\nsubway express as quicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered\nthat it went nearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I\nwished to reach, so that time would be saved at the end of the\njourney. I concluded in favor of the subway, and reached my\ndestination by one o\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369;\n1933: 91\u201392)\nFerryboat\n: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of\nthe boat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he\nwould need some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also\nneed poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more\nprobable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion\nthat the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the\ndirection in which the boat pointed, to enable him to steer\ncorrectly.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\nBubbles\n: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\nWeather\n: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\nDisorder\n: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\nTyphoid\n: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\nBlur\n: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\nSuction pump\n: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\nDiamond\n: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\nRash\n: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\nCandidate\n: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\nsuggestions\n, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem\nto be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis\n, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (\nreasoning\n, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\nTransit\nmight have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\nTyphoid\nas avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\nObserving\n: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\nWeather\n,\nbubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\nBubbles\n,\na moving blur in the distance in\nBlur\n,\na rash in\nRash\n).\nOr one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\nDisorder\n,\nno suction without air pressure in\nSuction pump\n)\nFeeling\n: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\nTransit\n,\nwhy the diamonds vary in spacing in\nDiamond\n).\nOne wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit\n, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond\n).\nWondering\n: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nhow suction pumps work in\nSuction pump\n,\nwhat caused the rash in\nRash\n).\nImagining\n: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\nTransit\n,\nflagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\nFerryboat\n,\nallergic reaction or heat rash in\nRash\n).\nInferring\n: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\nearlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\nRash\n).\nOr one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\nTransit\n,\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\ndiscontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\nRash\n).\nKnowledge\n: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\nTransit\n,\nof the requirements for a flagpole in\nFerryboat\n,\nof Boyle\u2019s law in\nBubbles\n,\nof allergic reactions in\nRash\n).\nExperimenting\n: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\nFerryboat\n,\nputting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nmeasuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\nSuction pump\n,\nnoticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\nDiamond\n).\nConsulting\n: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\nCandidate\nincludes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments\n: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\nCandidate\n.\nIt is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging\n: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\nFerryboat\nthat the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding\n: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\nTransit\nto take the subway.\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\nAttentiveness\n: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\nWeather\nwould not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry\n: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\nBubbles\ncould easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence\n: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\nRash\nlacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage\n: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness\n: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment\n: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason\n: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth\n: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\nSupplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions\n.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\nTransit\n,\nhas some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\nsection 6\nas components of the critical thinking process described in\nsection 5\n.\nThe derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\nObservational abilities\n: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9). There\nare items testing a person\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of\nobservation reports in the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests, Levels X\nand Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005). Norris and King (1983, 1985, 1990a, 1990b) is a test of ability\nto appraise observation reports.\nEmotional abilities\n: The emotions that drive a critical\nthinking process are perplexity or puzzlement, a wish to resolve it,\nand satisfaction at a",

Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n1.

History\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\nSupplement on Assessment\n.\nEducational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\nFor details on this history, see the\nSupplement on History\n.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\nTransit\n: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down\non a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I\nreturned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway\nexpress. But was there a station near? If not, I might lose more than\ntwenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and\nI saw there was such a line within two blocks. But where was the\nstation? If it were several blocks above or below the street I was on,\nI should lose time instead of gaining it. My mind went back to the\nsubway express as quicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered\nthat it went nearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I\nwished to reach, so that time would be saved at the end of the\njourney. I concluded in favor of the subway, and reached my\ndestination by one o\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369;\n1933: 91\u201392)\nFerryboat\n: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of\nthe boat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he\nwould need some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also\nneed poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more\nprobable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion\nthat the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the\ndirection in which the boat pointed, to enable him to steer\ncorrectly.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\nBubbles\n: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\nWeather\n: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\nDisorder\n: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\nTyphoid\n: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\nBlur\n: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\nSuction pump\n: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\nDiamond\n: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\nRash\n: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\nCandidate\n: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\nsuggestions\n, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem\nto be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis\n, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (\nreasoning\n, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\nTransit\nmight have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\nTyphoid\nas avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\nObserving\n: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\nWeather\n,\nbubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\nBubbles\n,\na moving blur in the distance in\nBlur\n,\na rash in\nRash\n).\nOr one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\nDisorder\n,\nno suction without air pressure in\nSuction pump\n)\nFeeling\n: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\nTransit\n,\nwhy the diamonds vary in spacing in\nDiamond\n).\nOne wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit\n, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond\n).\nWondering\n: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nhow suction pumps work in\nSuction pump\n,\nwhat caused the rash in\nRash\n).\nImagining\n: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\nTransit\n,\nflagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\nFerryboat\n,\nallergic reaction or heat rash in\nRash\n).\nInferring\n: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\nearlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\nRash\n).\nOr one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\nTransit\n,\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\ndiscontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\nRash\n).\nKnowledge\n: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\nTransit\n,\nof the requirements for a flagpole in\nFerryboat\n,\nof Boyle\u2019s law in\nBubbles\n,\nof allergic reactions in\nRash\n).\nExperimenting\n: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\nFerryboat\n,\nputting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nmeasuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\nSuction pump\n,\nnoticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\nDiamond\n).\nConsulting\n: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\nCandidate\nincludes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments\n: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\nCandidate\n.\nIt is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging\n: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\nFerryboat\nthat the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding\n: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\nTransit\nto take the subway.\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\nAttentiveness\n: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\nWeather\nwould not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry\n: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\nBubbles\ncould easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence\n: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\nRash\nlacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage\n: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness\n: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment\n: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason\n: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth\n: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\nSupplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions\n.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\nTransit\n,\nhas some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\nsection 6\nas components of the critical thinking process described in\nsection 5\n.\nThe derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\nObservational abilities\n: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9). There\nare items testing a person\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of\nobservation reports in the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests, Levels X\nand Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005). Norris and King (1983, 1985, 1990a, 1990b) is a test of ability\nto appraise observation reports.\nEmotional abilities\n: The emotions that drive a critical\nthinking process are perplexity or puzzlement, a wish to resolve it,\nand satisfaction at a\n\n\n\n---\n\nThe council should use all of this context when addressing the prompt above.

Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n1.

History\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\nSupplement on Assessment\n.\nEducational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\nFor details on this history, see the\nSupplement on History\n.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\nTransit\n: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down\non a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I\nreturned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway\nexpress. But was there a station near? If not, I might lose more than\ntwenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and\nI saw there was such a line within two blocks. But where was the\nstation? If it were several blocks above or below the street I was on,\nI should lose time instead of gaining it. My mind went back to the\nsubway express as quicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered\nthat it went nearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I\nwished to reach, so that time would be saved at the end of the\njourney. I concluded in favor of the subway, and reached my\ndestination by one o\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369;\n1933: 91\u201392)\nFerryboat\n: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of\nthe boat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he\nwould need some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also\nneed poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more\nprobable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion\nthat the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the\ndirection in which the boat pointed, to enable him to steer\ncorrectly.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\nBubbles\n: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\nWeather\n: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\nDisorder\n: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\nTyphoid\n: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\nBlur\n: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\nSuction pump\n: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\nDiamond\n: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\nRash\n: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\nCandidate\n: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\nsuggestions\n, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem\nto be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis\n, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (\nreasoning\n, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\nTransit\nmight have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\nTyphoid\nas avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\nObserving\n: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\nWeather\n,\nbubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\nBubbles\n,\na moving blur in the distance in\nBlur\n,\na rash in\nRash\n).\nOr one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\nDisorder\n,\nno suction without air pressure in\nSuction pump\n)\nFeeling\n: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\nTransit\n,\nwhy the diamonds vary in spacing in\nDiamond\n).\nOne wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit\n, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond\n).\nWondering\n: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nhow suction pumps work in\nSuction pump\n,\nwhat caused the rash in\nRash\n).\nImagining\n: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\nTransit\n,\nflagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\nFerryboat\n,\nallergic reaction or heat rash in\nRash\n).\nInferring\n: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\nearlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\nRash\n).\nOr one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\nTransit\n,\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\ndiscontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\nRash\n).\nKnowledge\n: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\nTransit\n,\nof the requirements for a flagpole in\nFerryboat\n,\nof Boyle\u2019s law in\nBubbles\n,\nof allergic reactions in\nRash\n).\nExperimenting\n: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\nFerryboat\n,\nputting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nmeasuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\nSuction pump\n,\nnoticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\nDiamond\n).\nConsulting\n: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\nCandidate\nincludes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments\n: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\nCandidate\n.\nIt is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging\n: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\nFerryboat\nthat the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding\n: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\nTransit\nto take the subway.\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\nAttentiveness\n: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\nWeather\nwould not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry\n: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\nBubbles\ncould easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence\n: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\nRash\nlacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage\n: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness\n: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment\n: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason\n: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth\n: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\nSupplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions\n.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\nTransit\n,\nhas some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\nsection 6\nas components of the critical thinking process described in\nsection 5\n.\nThe derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\nObservational abilities\n: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9). There\nare items testing a person\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of\nobservation reports in the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests, Levels X\nand Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005). Norris and King (1983, 1985, 1990a, 1990b) is a test of ability\nto appraise observation reports.\nEmotional abilities\n: The emotions that drive a critical\nthinking process are perplexity or puzzlement, a wish to resolve it,\nand satisfaction at a\n\n\n\n---\n\nThe council should use all of this context when addressing the prompt above.

People are living longer and prefer to age in the comfort of their home.\u201d\n- **Normative (value-laden)**: About what people should value or want.  \n  - \u201cEvery home will need and want a care robot to reduce home risk factors for their aging parents and give peace of mind to rest of the family.\u201d  \n    \u2192 Assumes that **buying a robot is a good and acceptable way to care for parents**.\n\n### 2.2 Why identifying assumptions is crucial\n\n- Assumptions are often **where arguments are weakest**.\n- If an assumption is false, exaggerated, or only sometimes true, then the **conclusion or plan may be flawed**, even if the reasoning looks polished.\n- In decision-making (e.g., should you invest in this robot company? should a family buy one?), surfacing assumptions helps you ask:\n  - \u201cUnder what conditions would this fail?\u201d\n  - \u201cWhat has to be true for this to work?\u201d\n\n### 2.3 Simple method: How to spot assumptions\n\nUse these prompts:\n\n1. **\u201cFor this to be true, what else must be true?\u201d**  \n   - Example: \u201cCare social robots don\u2019t substitute for the human being\u2014they help when no one else is there to help.\u201d  \n     - Assumption: There will frequently be times \u201cwhen no one else is there to help.\u201d\n2. **\u201cWhat is not being said?\u201d**  \n   - Are there hidden constraints (regulation, costs, tech limits, user adoption)?\n3. **\u201cWhat does this claim quietly rely on about people, markets, or technology?\u201d**  \n   - About people: Will seniors accept robots in their homes?  \n   - About markets: Will enough affluent caregivers pay $1,000 + $100/month?  \n   - About tech: Can AI really deliver safe, empathetic, context-aware care interaction at scale?\n\nWe\u2019ll practice with the actual pitch content.\n\n---\n\n## Exercise 1 \u2013 Identifying Assumptions in the Care Robot Pitch\n\n**Your task:** Read the short scenario and list **at least 3\u20135 assumptions** you see.\n\n### Scenario (based on the slides)\n\nA startup pitches a **Home Care Companion Robot** for older adults living alone. In their slides they say:\n\n- \u201c28% of seniors in the US live alone\u2026 Loneliness and social isolation increase the risk of dementia by 50%\u2026 The health effects of loneliness are equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes each day.\u201d\n- \u201cWe believe every home will need and want a care robot to reduce home risk factors for their aging parents and give peace of mind to the rest of the family.\u201d\n- Business model:  \n  - $1,000 setup and family training  \n  - $100/month care support services  \n  - Aim for 100 pilot units by end of 2026 and 1,000 online sales by 2027.  \n- They emphasize:\n  - Their robots use **reminiscence therapy, CBT techniques, body language, relationship-building** via memory and interaction history, and **proactive context-aware interactions**.\n\n### Questions for you\n\n1. **List at least 3\u20135 assumptions** in this pitch.  \n   - Try to include **both**:\n     - Assumptions about **people** (older adults, family caregivers, clinicians, payers).\n     - Assumptions about **technology / business / regulation**.\n2. For **one** of those assumptions, briefly say:\n   - Why it matters (i.e., how it could affect whether the idea succeeds or fails).\n\nYou can answer in bullet points or short sentences.\n\n---\n\n**Please provide your response to Exercise 1.**  \nOnce you reply, I\u2019ll move on to:\n\n- Concept 2: Evaluating Evidence  \n- Exercise 2 (also using the robot and its health-statistics claims)"

Drawing from the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*, we define critical thinking not merely as \"being negative,\" but as **\"careful thinking directed to a goal.\"** It involves the disposition to inquire, the ability to judge the credibility of sources, and the skill to infer conclusions based on sound evidence.\n\nTo move beyond abstract theory, we will use a **Case Study Method**. I have analyzed the uploaded pitch deck for **\"Navigait\" (The Home Rui Robot)**, a startup proposing a physical AI robot for elderly care. We will use this real-world business pitch to test your ability to deconstruct arguments, identify biases, and evaluate evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Part 1: The Anatomy of an Argument & Identifying Assumptions**\n\n**Concepts:**\nBefore we can critique ideas, we must understand their structure. In critical thinking, an **Argument** is not a verbal disagreement. It is a set of claims (Premises) offered as reasons to believe a specific claim (Conclusion).\n\nOften, the most vulnerable part of an argument is what is *not* said. These are **Assumptions**\u2014beliefs taken for granted by the speaker that must be true for the argument to hold.\n\n*   **Explicit Premise:** What is stated (e.g., \"It is raining\").\n*   **Conclusion:** What they want you to believe/do (e.g., \"Take an umbrella\").\n*   **Hidden Assumption:** The unstated link (e.g., \"You want to stay dry\" or \"Umbrellas are effective against rain\").\n\n**Critical Thinking Habit:** A critical thinker pauses before accepting a conclusion to ask: *\"What must this person believe to be true that they aren't saying out loud?\"*\n\n***\n\n### **Exercise 1: The \"Every Home\" Hypothesis**\n\nLet\u2019s apply this to the **Navigait Pitch Deck**.\n\n**Context:**\nOn **Slide 14 (\"Opportunity\")**, the founders make a bold conclusion:\n> *\"We believe every home will need and want a care robot to reduce home risk factors for their aging parents and give peace of mind to rest of the family.\"*\n\nTo support this, they highlight that the world is aging, caregivers are in short supply, and physical AI is a trillion-dollar opportunity.\n\n**Your Task:**\nImagine you are a venture capitalist evaluating this slide. Validating this conclusion (\"Every home will need and want... [this] robot\") requires accepting several unstated premises.\n\n**Please list 3 distinct assumptions that must be true for the company's conclusion to be valid.**\n\n*(Think about: Financial accessibility mentioned in Slide 11, the technological capabilities of robots mentioned in Slide 6, or cultural attitudes toward machines.)*\n\n**> Please type your critical analysis below. Once you provide your response, we will analyze your answer and move to Part 2.**"

            "response": "# COMPREHENSIVE CRITICAL THINKING TRAINING MODULE\n\n## Introduction: Welcome to Critical Thinking Mastery\n\nCritical thinking is **careful goal-directed thinking** that helps you make better decisions, solve complex problems, and navigate an increasingly complex world. This skill is essential whether you're evaluating a business proposal, assessing health information, or making important life decisions.\n\nThis module will guide you through core concepts, interactive exercises, and practical applications. Each section builds upon the previous one, so please engage thoughtfully with each exercise before moving forward.\n\n---\n\n## MODULE 1: Foundation - What is Critical Thinking?\n\n### Core Definition\nCritical thinking involves three essential features:\n1. **Purpose**: Making up your mind about what to believe or do\n2. **Standards**: Trying to fulfill standards of adequacy and accuracy\n3. **Threshold**: Meeting relevant standards to a sufficient level\n\nIn simpler terms: **Critical thinking is careful, goal-directed thinking that helps you reach sound conclusions.**\n\n### The Critical Thinking Process\n\nBased on John Dewey's framework, critical thinking typically involves:\n\n1. **Noticing** a difficulty or perplexity\n2. **Defining** the problem clearly\n3. **Generating** possible solutions or explanations\n4. **Gathering** relevant evidence\n5. **Evaluating** alternatives systematically\n6. **Drawing** reasoned conclusions\n7. **Testing** your conclusions when possible\n\n**Important**: This isn't always a linear process. You may cycle through steps, revise your problem definition, or gather more evidence as you go.\n\n---\n\n## MODULE 2: Core Concepts of Critical Thinking\n\n### Concept 1: Identifying Assumptions\n\n**What are assumptions?**\nAssumptions are beliefs we take for granted without proof. They're the unstated premises underlying our reasoning.\n\n**Why identify them?**\n- Hidden assumptions can lead us astray\n- Making assumptions explicit allows us to test them\n- Understanding our assumptions helps us communicate more clearly\n\n**Example from the Home Care Robot presentation:**\n- **Stated claim**: \"We believe every home will need and want a care robot\"\n- **Underlying assumptions**: \n  - Families can afford the technology ($1000 + $100/month)\n  - Seniors will accept robot companionship\n  - The technology will work reliably in diverse home environments\n  - The caregiver shortage will continue\n\n---\n\n### EXERCISE 1: Identifying Assumptions\n\n**Scenario**: The Home Care Robot presentation claims that \"loneliness and social isolation increase the risk of dementia by 50%.\"\n\n**Your task**: \n1. What assumptions underlie using this statistic to justify the robot solution?\n2. List at least 3 assumptions you can identify\n3. Which of these assumptions would you want to verify before accepting the argument?\n\n*Please write your response before continuing. Consider: What must be true for a robot to address this problem? What's being assumed about the nature of loneliness and how to combat it?*\n\n---\n\n[PAUSE FOR USER RESPONSE]\n\n---\n\n### Concept 2: Evaluating Evidence\n\n**What makes evidence strong?**\n\n**Quality indicators:**\n- **Relevance**: Directly relates to the claim\n- **Sufficiency**: Adequate amount to support the conclusion\n- **Credibility**: From trustworthy, expert sources\n- **Accuracy**: Verifiable and correctly reported\n- **Representativeness**: Not cherry-picked or biased samples\n- **Recency**: Current enough for the context\n\n**Evidence hierarchy** (generally, from strongest to weakest):\n1. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses\n2. Randomized controlled trials\n3. Cohort studies\n4. Case-control studies\n5. Expert opinion\n6. Anecdotal evidence\n\n**Red flags in evidence:**\n- Vague sourcing (\"studies show...\")\n- Outdated information\n- Conflicts of interest\n- Sample sizes too small\n- Correlation presented as causation\n\n---\n\n### EXERCISE 2: Evaluating Evidence\n\n**Scenario**: Review the evidence presented in the Home Care Robot pitch:\n\n**Evidence presented:**\n- \"28% of seniors in the US live alone, totaling more than 14.7 million people\"\n- \"Loneliness and social isolation increase the risk of dementia by 50%\"\n- \"4 years of research & development\"\n- \"5 Working Robots Built\"\n- \"1 Robot Deployed at UCI for Research\"\n\n**Your task**:\n1. Evaluate the strength of this evidence for the claim that this robot will be commercially successful\n2. What evidence is strongest? What is weakest?\n3. What additional evidence would you want to see before investing $5.5 million?\n4. Are there any red flags in how the evidence is presented?\n\n*Take time to analyze each piece of evidence critically. Consider both what's presented and what's missing.*\n\n---\n\n[PAUSE FOR USER RESPONSE]\n\n---\n\n### Concept 3: Recognizing Cognitive Biases\n\n**What are cognitive biases?**\nSystematic patterns of deviation from rational judgment. They're mental shortcuts that can lead to errors.\n\n**Common biases affecting decision-making:**\n\n1. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence\n   - *Example*: Only reading positive reviews of the robot technology while dismissing concerns\n\n2. **Availability Bias**: Overweighting easily recalled information\n   - *Example*: Overestimating robot success because of recent positive news about AI\n\n3. **Anchoring Bias**: Over-relying on the first piece of information encountered\n   - *Example*: The $5.5M ask becoming your reference point for value\n\n4. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Continuing investment due to past investment rather than future potential\n   - *Example*: \"We've already spent 4 years on R&D, so we must continue\"\n\n5. **Optimism Bias**: Overestimating positive outcomes and underestimating risks\n   - *Example*: \"Every home will need and want a care robot\"\n\n6. **Bandwagon Effect**: Believing something because many others do\n   - *Example*: \"Physical AI is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, so this must succeed\"\n\n---\n\n### EXERCISE 3: Identifying Biases\n\n**Scenario**: You're evaluating whether to invest in the Home Care Robot company. Consider this thinking process:\n\n*\"I just read about how AI is transforming everything. This robot idea seems innovative, and they've already built 5 working prototypes. The founders have impressive academic credentials. Everyone's talking about the aging population crisis. They're asking for $5.5M, which seems reasonable for this stage. I'm excited about getting in early on what could be the next big thing.\"*\n\n**Your task**:\n1. Identify at least 3 cognitive biases present in this thinking\n2. For each bias, explain how it might lead to a poor decision\n3. How would you counter each bias to think more critically?\n\n*Be honest: Which of these biases might you be susceptible to in this situation?*\n\n---\n\n[PAUSE FOR USER RESPONSE]\n\n---\n\n### Concept 4: Logical Fallacies\n\n**What are logical fallacies?**\nErrors in reasoning that undermine the logic of an argument. Even with true premises, fallacious reasoning leads to unreliable conclusions.\n\n**Common fallacies to recognize:**\n\n1. **Appeal to Authority** (Ad Verecundiam)\n   - Accepting a claim because an authority says it, without evaluating the evidence\n   - *Example*: \"Dr. Rashid has credentials, so the robot must work\"\n   - *Why problematic*: Experts can be wrong; expertise in one area doesn't transfer to all areas\n\n2. **Appeal to Emotion**\n   - Manipulating emotions rather than using valid reasoning\n   - *Example*: Using images of lonely seniors to bypass critical evaluation\n   - *Why problematic*: Emotional appeals distract from logical analysis\n\n3. **False Dilemma** (False Binary)\n   - Presenting only two options when more exist\n   - *Example*: \"Either we invest in robot care or seniors suffer alone\"\n   - *Why problematic*: Ignores other solutions (human caregivers, community programs, etc.)\n\n4. **Hasty Generalization**\n   - Drawing broad conclusions from insufficient evidence\n   - *Example*: \"One robot worked at UCI, therefore all seniors will benefit\"\n   - *Why problematic*: Sample size too small; conditions may not generalize\n\n5. **Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc** (False Cause)\n   - Assuming that because B follows A, A caused B\n   - *Example*: \"Seniors who got robots felt better, so robots cure loneliness\"\n   - *Why problematic*: Correlation \u2260 causation; other factors may be responsible\n\n6. **Slippery Slope**\n   - Arguing that a small step will inevitably lead to extreme consequences\n   - *Example*: \"If we don't invest now, we'll miss the entire robot revolution\"\n   - *Why problematic*: Assumes inevitability without justification\n\n7. **Straw Man**\n   - Misrepresenting an opposing argument to make it easier to attack\n   - *Example*: \"Critics just don't care about lonely seniors\"\n   - *Why problematic*: Doesn't address actual concerns (cost, efficacy, etc.)\n\n8. **Ad Hominem**\n   - Attacking the person rather than their argument\n   - *Example*: \"That critic is just old-fashioned and afraid of technology\"\n   - *Why problematic*: Personal characteristics don't invalidate logical arguments\n\n---\n\n### EXERCISE 4: Spotting Fallacies\n\n**Scenario**: You're reviewing arguments about the Home Care Robot. Identify the fallacy in each statement:\n\n**Statement A**: \"Leading universities like Case Western and Notre Dame are researching our robot, so it must be an effective solution to senior loneliness.\"\n\n**Statement B**: \"Physical AI represents a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity across numerous industries. Therefore, our home care robot will be profitable.\"\n\n**Statement C**: \"Either families purchase our care robot for their aging parents, or they're condemning them to dangerous isolation and preventable falls.\"\n\n**Statement D**: \"Our competitor's robots focus on physical labor, which shows they don't truly care about the emotional needs of seniors like we do.\"\n\n**Your task**:\n1. Identify the specific fallacy in each statement (A-D)\n2. Explain why it's fallacious\n3. How would you reframe each argument to make it logically sound?\n\n---\n\n[PAUSE FOR USER RESPONSE]\n\n---\n\n### Concept 5: Constructing Sound Arguments\n\n**What makes an argument sound?**\n\nA sound argument has:\n1. **Valid structure**: Conclusion follows logically from premises\n2. **True premises**: Starting points are factually correct\n3. **Relevant premises**: Each premise actually supports the conclusion\n4. **Sufficient support**: Premises adequately justify the conclusion\n\n**Basic argument structure:**\n\n```\nPremise 1: [Statement of fact or accepted principle]\nPremise 2: [Statement of fact or accepted principle]\nPremise 3: [Optional additional premises]\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nTherefore, Conclusion: [Logical result of premises]\n```\n\n**Example of a sound argument:**\n```\nPremise 1: All pilots must complete 1,500 flight hours to fly commercially\nPremise 2: Sarah has completed 2,000 flight hours\nPremise 3: Sarah has passed all required certifications\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion: Sarah is qualified to fly commercially\n```\n\n**Example of an unsound argument (valid structure, questionable premise):**\n```\nPremise 1: All AI-powered robots reduce loneliness\nPremise 2: This is an AI-powered robot\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nConclusion: This robot will reduce loneliness\n```\n*Problem: Premise 1 is unproven and likely false*\n\n---\n\n### EXERCISE 5: Building Sound Arguments\n\n**Scenario**: You need to construct a well-reasoned argument either FOR or AGAINST investing in the Home Care Robot company.\n\n**Your task**:\n1. Choose your position (for or against investment)\n2. Construct an argument with:\n   - At least 3 clear premises\n   - A logical conclusion\n   - Each premise supported by evidence from the presentation or reasonable inference\n3. Check your own argument:\n   - Are all premises true (or at least well-supported)?\n   - Does the conclusion follow logically?\n   - Are you avoiding the fallacies we discussed?\n   - Have you considered counterarguments?\n\n*This is your opportunity to synthesize what you've learned. Take your time to construct the strongest possible argument.*\n\n---\n\n[PAUSE FOR USER RESPONSE]\n\n---\n\n## MODULE 3: Practical Applications\n\n### Application 1: Critical Thinking in Decision-Making\n\n**Framework for critical decision-making:**\n\n**Step 1: Define the decision clearly**\n- What exactly are you deciding?\n- What are your constraints (time, money, values)?\n- What would constitute success?\n\n**Step 2: Gather relevant information**\n- What do you need to know?\n- What sources are credible?\n- What's missing?\n\n**Step 3: Identify alternatives**\n- What are all possible options?\n- Avoid false dilemmas\n- Consider creative combinations\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate alternatives systematically**\n- List criteria for evaluation\n- Weigh each option against criteria\n- Consider both short and long-term consequences\n- Identify risks and uncertainties\n\n**Step 5: Consider biases and assumptions**\n- What am I taking for granted?\n- What biases might be affecting my judgment?\n- Have I sought diverse perspectives?\n\n**Step 6: Make a decision and create an action plan**\n- Choose based on evidence and reasoning\n- Plan implementation steps\n- Identify what would indicate success or failure\n\n**Step 7: Review and adjust**\n- Monitor outcomes\n- Be willing to change course if evidence warrants\n- Learn from the process\n\n---\n\n### EXERCISE 6: Applying the Decision Framework\n\n**Real-world scenario**: \n\nYou are a member of the \"Sandwich Generation\" - caring for both your children and your 78-year-old mother who lives alone 500 miles away. Your mother is generally healthy but occasionally forgets things and had a minor fall last year. You're considering several options:\n\n**Option A**: Purchase the Home Care Robot ($1,000 + $100/month)\n**Option B**: Hire a part-time human caregiver (approximately $2,000/month for 20 hours/week)\n**Option C**: Move your mother to an assisted living facility near you ($4,000/month)\n**Option D**: Install home monitoring systems and increase phone check-ins ($200 setup + $50/month)\n**Option E**: Have your mother move in with your family\n\n**Your task**: Use the 7-step decision framework to work through this scenario.\n\n1.

            "response": "Below is the comprehensive training module on critical thinking, designed as per your instructions. As an expert critical thinking instructor, I've structured it logically in a step-by-step format to make it easy to follow, engaging, and progressive. The module draws on foundational concepts from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on critical thinking (e.g., Dewey's emphasis on reflective thinking, dispositions like open-mindedness, and processes like hypothesis testing). To make it practical and relevant, I've incorporated elements from the uploaded PowerPoint file on the \"Home Rui Robot\" (a proposed AI companion robot for elderly care to combat social isolation). This real-world startup pitch serves as a unifying theme for examples and exercises, allowing learners to apply critical thinking to a complex, timely issue involving health, technology, business, and ethics.\n\nThe module is divided into sections: **Introduction**, **Core Concepts**, **Interactive Exercises**, and **Practical Applications**. Each exercise includes a clear problem or scenario, guidance for analysis, and a prompt for your response (as the learner). I'll pause after each exercise to simulate interactivity\u2014 in a real training setting, you'd respond before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n# Critical Thinking Training Module: Thinking Clearly in a Complex World\n\n## Introduction\nWelcome to this training module on critical thinking! Critical thinking is the art of careful, goal-directed reasoning to make better decisions and solve problems effectively. As defined in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, it's \"careful thinking directed to a goal,\" involving reflection, evidence evaluation, and avoiding hasty conclusions (much like John Dewey's examples of everyday problem-solving, such as figuring out a ferryboat pole's purpose).\n\nWhy does this matter? In today's world, we're bombarded with information\u2014from startup pitches like the Home Rui Robot (an AI companion designed to reduce elderly loneliness) to news and personal decisions. Poor critical thinking can lead to flawed choices, while strong skills empower you to navigate complexity with confidence.\n\nThis module will:\n- Explain key concepts.\n- Offer hands-on exercises using the Home Rui Robot pitch as a case study (based on the provided slides about social isolation risks, robot features, business strategy, and funding ask).\n- Guide you on applying these skills in real life.\n\nLet's dive in. We'll progress step by step\u2014complete each exercise before moving on to build your skills progressively.\n\n## Section 1: Core Critical Thinking Concepts\nHere, we'll define and explain five foundational concepts, with simple explanations, examples from everyday life, and ties to the Home Rui Robot pitch for relevance. These build on the Stanford entry's emphasis on dispositions (e.g., open-mindedness) and abilities (e.g., inferring and experimenting).\n\n### 1.1 Identifying Assumptions\n**Definition**: Assumptions are unstated beliefs or ideas we take for granted as true, often without evidence. Critical thinking involves spotting them to check if they're valid\u2014failing to do so can lead to flawed reasoning (as in Dewey's \"confirmation bias\" warnings).\n\n**Explanation**: Assumptions underpin arguments but can be hidden. For example, assuming \"all technology improves lives\" might blind you to risks. In the Home Rui Robot pitch, an assumption is that AI can fully mimic human companionship to reduce health risks like dementia (Slide 2 cites loneliness stats, but assumes robots solve it equivalently to human interaction).\n\n### 1.2 Evaluating Evidence\n**Definition**: This means assessing the quality, relevance, and credibility of information supporting a claim. Use criteria like source reliability, recency, and bias (per the Stanford entry's focus on judging credibility).\n\n**Explanation**: Strong evidence is verifiable and from diverse sources; weak evidence is anecdotal or cherry-picked. For instance, evaluating a news claim involves checking facts. In the robot pitch, evidence includes stats on isolation risks (Slide 2, sourced from consumeraffairs.com) and research links (Slide 8), but you'd evaluate if they're comprehensive or if counter-evidence (e.g., robot limitations) is ignored.\n\n### 1.3 Recognizing Biases\n**Definition**: Biases are preconceived notions that distort thinking, such as confirmation bias (favoring info that matches your views) or optimism bias (overestimating positives).\n\n**Explanation**: Everyone has biases; recognizing them promotes open-mindedness (a key disposition from the Stanford entry). In a job interview, bias might make you overlook a candidate's flaws. In the Home Rui Robot pitch, the team might have optimism bias in projecting \"hyper-scale\" sales by 2028 (Slide 11), assuming rapid adoption without addressing caregiver shortages or ethical concerns.\n\n### 1.4 Logical Fallacies\n**Definition**: These are errors in reasoning that make arguments invalid, like ad hominem (attacking the person, not the idea) or false dichotomy (presenting only two options when more exist).\n\n**Explanation**: Spotting fallacies prevents manipulation. For example, \"slippery slope\" assumes one action leads to extreme outcomes without evidence. The robot pitch might imply a false dichotomy: either buy our robot or let elders suffer isolation (Slide 14), ignoring alternatives like community programs.\n\n### 1.5 Constructing Sound Arguments\n**Definition**: A sound argument has a clear claim, logical structure (premises leading to a conclusion), and strong evidence without fallacies.\n\n**Explanation**: Build one by stating your position, supporting it with facts, and addressing counterarguments (aligning with Dewey's hypothesis-testing process). For the robot, a sound argument might be: \"Premise 1: Isolation increases dementia risk (evidence: stats). Premise 2: Our AI uses CBT for interaction (Slide 6). Conclusion: It reduces risks\u2014 but only if tested in diverse homes.\"\n\nThese concepts interconnect: Spot assumptions to evaluate evidence, recognize biases to avoid fallacies, and build sound arguments.\n\n## Section 2: Interactive Exercises\nNow, let's practice! We'll use scenarios inspired by the Home Rui Robot pitch. Each exercise focuses on 1-2 core concepts, provides a problem, and guides your analysis. Respond in your own words (e.g., via text or discussion), then proceed. Aim for thoughtful, evidence-based responses.\n\n### Exercise 1: Identifying Assumptions and Recognizing Biases\n**Scenario**: The Home Rui Robot pitch claims that their AI companion, using reminiscence therapy and body language (Slide 6), will reduce elderly isolation risks equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day (Slide 2). They project reaching 1,000 sales by 2027 and Medicare approval by 2028 (Slide 11), targeting affluent caregivers.\n\n**Problem**: Identify 2-3 assumptions in this pitch and any potential biases. How might these affect the proposal's credibility?\n\n**Guidance**: Review the slides for unstated beliefs (e.g., assuming tech adoption is easy for elders). Consider biases like over-optimism in market projections. Reference core concepts.\n\n**Your Response**: Please provide your analysis here (e.g., \"Assumption 1: ... Bias: ... Impact: ...\"). Once you've responded, proceed to the next exercise.\n\n[Pause for your response.]\n\n### Exercise 2: Evaluating Evidence and Spotting Logical Fallacies\n**Scenario**: Slide 14 states, \"We believe every home will need and want a care robot to reduce home risk factors,\" backed by aging population trends and caregiver shortages. They cite 4 years of R&D and university deployments (Slides 8 and 13).\n\n**Problem**: Evaluate the evidence for this claim. Identify any logical fallacies. Is the argument sound, or does it need strengthening?\n\n**Guidance**: Assess evidence quality (e.g., are links credible? Is there counter-evidence like privacy risks?). Look for fallacies (e.g., hasty generalization from pilot tests). Build a brief counter-argument if needed.\n\n**Your Response**: Share your evaluation (e.g., \"Evidence strength: ... Fallacy: ... Suggested improvement: ...\"). Proceed after responding.\n\n[Pause for your response.]\n\n### Exercise 3: Constructing Sound Arguments\n**Scenario**: Imagine you're an investor reviewing the $5.5M funding ask (Slide 13). Milestones include built robots and university tests, but the pitch assumes AI will provide \"peace of mind\" without substituting humans (Slide 15).\n\n**Problem**: Construct a sound argument for or against investing. Include a claim, 2-3 premises with evidence from the slides, and address a potential counterargument.\n\n**Guidance**: Use the structure: Claim \u2192 Premises \u2192 Evidence \u2192 Counter \u2192 Rebuttal. Draw on all concepts (e.g., check assumptions, evaluate evidence).\n\n**Your Response**: Write your argument here (e.g., \"Claim: I would invest because...\"). Once done, move to applications.\n\n[Pause for your response.]\n\n## Section 3: Practical Applications\nYou've practiced the basics\u2014now apply them to real-world contexts. Critical thinking shines in decision-making (weighing options), problem-solving (testing hypotheses, like Dewey's examples), and analyzing complex info (e.g., sifting biases in data).\n\n### 3.1 In Decision-Making\nUse critical thinking to avoid impulse choices. Steps: Identify assumptions/biases, evaluate evidence, build arguments. **Example**: Deciding whether to buy a Home Rui Robot for an aging parent? Assume nothing\u2014evaluate evidence on isolation (Slide 2) vs. robot limits (e.g., no emotional depth). Argue: \"Pros: Proactive AI (Slide 6). Cons: High cost ($100/month, Slide 11). Decision: Trial it if evidence from pilots (Slide 13) is strong.\"\n\n### 3.2 In Problem-Solving\nFollow Dewey's process: Notice a problem, form hypotheses, test them. **Example**: Problem: Elderly isolation amid caregiver shortages (Slide 14). Hypothesis: Robots help. Test: Analyze pilots (Slide 13)\u2014did they reduce risks? If not, pivot to alternatives like telehealth. This fosters open-mindedness and evidence-based solutions.\n\n### 3.3 In Analyzing Complex Information\nSpot fallacies and biases in pitches, news, or data. **Example**: Analyzing the robot's \"multi-trillion-dollar opportunity\" (Slide 14). Recognize optimism bias, evaluate evidence (e.g., aging trends are real, but competition in social robots (Slide 4) is overlooked). Guidance: Cross-check sources, consider ethics (e.g., does AI exploit vulnerabilities?).\n\n**Final Engagement Tip**: Apply this to your life\u2014next time you see a tech pitch or news story, pause and use one concept. Revisit exercises with new scenarios for mastery.\n\nCongratulations! You've completed the module. If you'd like to discuss your exercise responses, expand on sections, or adapt for group training, let me know. Remember, critical thinking is a habit\u2014practice it daily for \"individual happiness and the reduction of social waste\" (Dewey)."

            "ranking": "Response A does some things well and others poorly.\n\n**What it does well:**\n- **Clear structure and roadmap.** It opens with a module roadmap that explicitly mirrors the user\u2019s requested concepts (assumptions, evidence, biases, fallacies, arguments, applications). This aligns well with the \u201cstep-by-step\u201d requirement and signals a coherent course design.\n- **Solid core concept explanation (assumptions).** It provides a clear definition of assumptions (explicit vs implicit, descriptive vs normative) and explains why surfacing them matters. This is consistent with the SEP\u2019s framing of critical thinking as careful, goal-directed thinking that examines grounds and implications.\n- **Effective use of context.** It sensibly leverages the Home Care Robot slides: quotes the \u201cevery home will need and want a care robot\u201d line, references the \u201cmulti-trillion-dollar opportunity,\u201d and uses those as examples of implicit assumptions about markets, people, and technology.\n- **Interactive exercise meets the brief.** Exercise 1 is well-constructed: the scenario is concrete, based on the uploaded deck, and the user is asked to list assumptions and analyze why one matters. It explicitly requests a response before moving on, satisfying the interaction requirement for that part.\n\n**What it does poorly:**\n- **Incomplete module.** It only delivers the introduction and Concept 1 plus Exercise 1. The prompt asks for a *comprehensive* training module covering evaluating evidence, biases, fallacies, constructing arguments, and practical applications. Here, those are only promised, not actually developed.\n- **Limited practical guidance.** Apart from a brief note about avoiding hype and making better decisions, it doesn\u2019t yet deliver the requested guidance on applying critical thinking to decision-making, problem-solving, and complex information.\n- **No exercises beyond assumptions.** The user explicitly wanted exercises tied to multiple concepts; this answer only provides one, with no structure yet for the rest.\n\nOverall, Response A is well-designed as an opening installment but does not fulfill the full scope of the requested module.\n\n---\n\nResponse B has strengths but is very narrow relative to the prompt.\n\n**What it does well:**\n- **Clear, correct conceptualization of arguments and assumptions.** It accurately explains arguments as premises supporting a conclusion, and clarifies explicit vs hidden assumptions with simple examples. This is pedagogically sound and aligned with basic informal logic.\n- **Use of the uploaded context.** It directly uses Slide 14\u2019s \u201cevery home will need and want a care robot\u201d statement and ties in other slides (tech capabilities, target buyer). The exercise is contextualized as a VC evaluating a pitch, which is realistic and engaging.\n- **Interactive exercise is focused and on-point.** The \u201cEvery Home Hypothesis\u201d task is very clear: list three assumptions underlying that bold conclusion from the pitch, from a VC\u2019s standpoint. It invites the kind of assumption-hunting the prompt requested.\n\n**What it does poorly:**\n- **Far from a \u201ccomprehensive training module.\u201d** It only covers a small slice of what was requested: basic argument structure and assumptions. There is no treatment of evaluating evidence, recognizing biases, logical fallacies, or constructing sound arguments, nor any practical decision-making frameworks.\n- **No overarching module design.** While it labels this as Part 1, it doesn\u2019t present a roadmap or structure for the full module; it functions more like a single exercise than a designed course.\n- **Minimal connection to the SEP\u2019s richer framework.** It briefly invokes the SEP definition (\u201ccareful thinking directed to a goal\u201d), but doesn\u2019t bring in Dewey\u2019s process, dispositions, or abilities in any depth.\n- **Only one exercise.** The user specifically asked for multiple interactive exercises across concepts; this answer provides just a single focused task.\n\nOverall, Response B is accurate and usable as one small component, but it does not meet the breadth or depth of the requested full module.\n\n---\n\nResponse C is the most thorough and aligned with the user\u2019s specification.\n\n**What it does well:**\n- **Comprehensive coverage of required concepts.** It systematically defines and explains:\n  - Identifying assumptions\n  - Evaluating evidence (with quality indicators, hierarchy of evidence, red flags)\n  - Recognizing cognitive biases (several major ones, with examples tied to the robot pitch)\n  - Logical fallacies (detailed list with definitions and robot-specific illustrations)\n  - Constructing sound arguments (validity, true/relevant premises, examples)\n  This directly fulfills point (1) of the prompt and is firmly in line with the SEP\u2019s view of critical thinking as norm-governed, goal-directed thinking.\n- **Extensive and well-designed exercises.** The module includes numerous exercises:\n  - Ex.1: Assumptions behind using the loneliness\u2013dementia statistic\n  - Ex.2: Evaluating evidence in the pitch (stats, R&D, deployments)\n  - Ex.3: Identifying biases in an investor\u2019s thought process\n  - Ex.4: Spotting specific fallacies in example statements from the pitch\n  - Ex.5: Constructing an argument for/against investing\n  - Ex.6\u20138: Applying decision-making and problem-solving frameworks, and doing a capstone analysis of the investment opportunity\n  - Ex.9 and the final plan: Disposition self-assessment and 90-day development plan  \n  Each exercise states a scenario, a clear multi-step task, and explicitly prompts the user to respond\u2014matching requirement (2) very well.\n- **Strong integration of uploaded and external context.** It makes extensive use of:\n  - The Home Care Robot deck (stats on isolation, business model, R&D milestones, funding ask, opportunity slide, segments, etc.)\n  - The Stanford article (Dewey\u2019s process, critical thinking as careful goal-directed thinking, dispositions and abilities, rationality, virtues)\n  It weaves these into definitions (e.g., dispositions like humility, courage), examples, and application frameworks.\n- **Robust practical application guidance.** Module 3 and beyond give clear frameworks for:\n  - Decision-making (seven-step process with explicit criteria, alternatives, risks, and bias checks)\n  - Problem-solving (problem definition, root cause analysis, solution generation, evaluation, iteration)\n  - Analyzing complex information (source, content, context, reasoning, verification)  \n  Each is illustrated with the robot case and supported by applied exercises, fulfilling requirement (3).\n- **Logical, step-by-step course structure.** It is broken into modules, each with:\n  - Conceptual explanation\n  - Exercises with \u201c[PAUSE FOR USER RESPONSE]\u201d\n  - Progressive build-up from basic definitions to high-level applications and self-development  \n  This satisfies (4): it\u2019s logically structured, reasonably clear, and engaging for someone serious about the topic.\n\n**What it does less well:**\n- **Length and density.** It is very long and might feel heavy for some learners; some users might prefer a more compact module. That said, the user explicitly asked for a *comprehensive* training module, so the length is defensible.\n- **\u201cPause\u201d vs. actual interaction.** Although it repeatedly instructs the learner to respond before continuing, all later content is provided in the same message. In practice this is more a scripted course outline than a truly interactive, stepwise dialogue. Response A and B better implement \u201cstopping after the first exercise\u201d in a live-chat sense. However, as a designed module/script, this still meets the spirit of the requirement.\n\nOverall, Response C best matches the specified scope, depth, and use of context.\n\n---\n\nResponse D is solid but less developed than Response C.\n\n**What it does well:**\n- **Direct integration of external and uploaded context.** It explicitly notes that it\u2019s drawing from the Stanford Encyclopedia and from the Home Rui Robot pitch, and refers to specific slides (e.g., Slide 2 stats, Slide 14 \u201cevery home will need and want a care robot,\u201d Slides 11 and 13).\n- **Covers all core concepts.** It defines:\n  - Identifying assumptions (with robot examples)\n  - Evaluating evidence (mentioning source credibility, etc., and applying it to stats and research links)\n  - Recognizing biases (confirmation, optimism, etc., applied to investor/robot context)\n  - Logical fallacies (several named, with robot-related illustrations)\n  - Constructing sound arguments (claim/premise structure and a robot-themed example)  \n  This satisfies requirement (1), albeit less deeply than Response C.\n- **Interactive exercises across multiple concepts.** There are three main exercises:\n  - Ex.1: Assumptions and biases in the pitch claims\n  - Ex.2: Evaluating evidence and spotting fallacies in \u201cevery home will need and want\u201d plus R&D/university evidence\n  - Ex.3: Constructing a sound argument for or against investing  \n  Each has a clear scenario, guidance, and a direct prompt for the user to respond. This meets requirement (2) at least partially.\n- **Some practical-application guidance.** Section 3 briefly discusses using critical thinking in:\n  - Decision-making (example: whether to buy the robot for a parent)\n  - Problem-solving (using Dewey-like hypothesis testing for the isolation problem)\n  - Analyzing complex information (e.g., interrogating the \u201cmulti-trillion-dollar opportunity\u201d claim)  \n  While shorter than C\u2019s frameworks, it does address requirement (3).\n\n**What it does poorly:**\n- **Less depth and breadth than C.** It offers only three exercises and a relatively thin treatment of applications, with no structured decision-making/problem-solving frameworks or explicit bias/fallacy exercises beyond a couple of high-level examples.\n- **Course design is less elaborated.** It labels pieces as \u201cSection 1, Section 2, Section 3\u201d but doesn\u2019t provide a detailed roadmap or multi-module progression; it feels more like a long lesson than a full training program.\n- **Same \u201cpause\u201d issue as C.** It instructs the learner to respond before moving on but the entire module appears in one message, so the interactive pacing is only conceptual.\n\nOverall, Response D is a competent, reasonably well-structured mini-module but less comprehensive and less richly framed than Response C.\n\n---\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1.

            "ranking": "Response A identifies the prompt as a request for an interactive session and correctly outlines a roadmap for the entire module before delivering the first segment. It integrates the Stanford definition effectively and uses the slide content well for the first exercise. It adheres strictly to the instruction to \"ask the user to provide their response before moving on.\" However, by stopping after the first concept, it fails to present the \"comprehensive training module\" requested in the prompt. As an evaluator, one cannot judge the quality of the ungenerated sections (concepts 2-5, applications, etc.), making it less useful as a \"design\" artifact than the full responses.\n\nResponse B creates a persona (AI Coach) and starts the session. It correctly identifies the definition and assumptions. However, it lacks a roadmap, so the user has no visibility into the scope of the training. Like Response A, it stops early, providing only a fraction of the requested content. It is the least comprehensive of the group.\n\nResponse C offers the most comprehensive and high-quality response. It interprets \"Design a training module\" as a request to generate the full curriculum content, while handling the \"step-by-step\" and \"pause\" instructions by structuring the text with clear placeholders (e.g., [PAUSE FOR USER RESPONSE]). This allows the user to evaluate the entire design\u2014definitions, exercises, and applications\u2014in a single view. It makes extensive and specific use of both the Stanford Encyclopedia (referencing Dewey, dispositions, etc.) and the Home Care Robot slides (using specific citations like the $5.5M ask, the $100/month fees, and specific logical fallacies in the pitch). The depth of the exercises and the inclusion of decision-making frameworks make it superior.\n\nResponse D also provides the full module content, making it useful for evaluation. It integrates the context well and follows a logical structure. However, it is significantly more concise than Response C. The definitions are briefer, fewer exercises are provided, and the formatting of the interactive pauses is less distinct. It is a solid response but lacks the depth and instructional design quality of Response C.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1. Response C\n2. Response D\n3. Response A\n4. Response B",

            "ranking": "### Evaluation of Response A\n**What it does well**: Response A provides a clear, logical structure with a module roadmap, starting with an introduction and progressing to concepts and exercises. It effectively integrates the Home Rui Robot pitch as a recurring example, making it engaging and relevant. It defines key concepts (starting with assumptions) in an easy-to-understand way, drawing from the Stanford Encyclopedia. The exercise is interactive, with a clear scenario based on the slides, specific questions for the user, and a pause for response before promising to move on. It offers high-level guidance on applications in the roadmap, and the tone is engaging and instructional.\n\n**What it does poorly**: The response feels incomplete, as it only covers the introduction and one concept/exercise in detail, with the rest outlined but not fleshed out (e.g., it promises more but stops at Exercise 1). It doesn't fully explain all required core concepts (only starts with assumptions, mentions others in the roadmap without detail). Practical applications are mentioned briefly in the roadmap but not elaborated with guidance or examples. It could be more comprehensive in tying back to all disallowed activities or deeper Stanford insights, and the exercises are limited to one in the provided content.\n\n### Evaluation of Response B\n**What it does well**: Response B has a professional tone and starts with a solid introduction, defining critical thinking from the Stanford source. It uses the Home Rui Robot pitch as a case study effectively for relevance. It explains one core concept (assumptions) clearly with examples from the slides, and the exercise is interactive, with a specific task tied to a slide, prompting user response before proceeding. The structure is logical, and it encourages critical analysis in a concise way.\n\n**What it does poorly**: It's highly incomplete, covering only one concept and one exercise, with no progression to the other required core concepts (e.g., no evaluation of evidence, biases, fallacies, or arguments). There's no guidance on practical applications, and it doesn't provide a full step-by-step module\u2014 it teases \"Part 2\" but doesn't deliver. It lacks engagement through multiple exercises or broader structure, and while it uses the slides, it doesn't weave in broader context like the full pitch or Stanford's detailed examples/processes.\n\n### Evaluation of Response C\n**What it does well**: Response C is exceptionally comprehensive, with a detailed step-by-step structure across multiple modules, covering all required core concepts thoroughly (assumptions, evidence, biases, fallacies, arguments) with clear definitions, examples, and ties to the Stanford Encyclopedia (e.g., Dewey's process). It integrates the Home Rui Robot pitch extensively as scenarios for exercises, making it highly engaging and relevant. There are numerous interactive exercises (8+), each with clear problems, guidance, and pauses for user responses. Practical applications are robust, with dedicated sections on decision-making, problem-solving, and analyzing information, including frameworks and additional exercises. It even extends to dispositions, self-assessment, and a development plan, enhancing depth and applicability. The tone is easy to understand, motivational, and structured for progression.\n\n**What it does poorly**: It's almost overly long, which might overwhelm learners despite being engaging; some sections (e.g., dispositions) go beyond the prompt's required concepts, potentially diluting focus. While it uses the slides well, it occasionally adds speculative elements (e.g., invented statements for fallacies) rather than sticking strictly to provided content. It doesn't explicitly address all Stanford details like controversies, but this is minor given its overall fidelity to the prompt.\n\n### Evaluation of Response D\n**What it does well**: Response D offers a well-structured module with sections for introduction, core concepts, exercises, and applications, making it logical and easy to follow. It explains all required core concepts clearly, with definitions, explanations, and examples tied to the Home Rui Robot slides and Stanford insights (e.g., Dewey's process). The exercises (3 in total) are interactive, with scenarios from the pitch, clear guidance, and pauses for responses. Practical applications provide guidance on decision-making, problem-solving, and analyzing information, with examples. It's engaging, concise yet comprehensive, and ends with a motivational conclusion.\n\n**What it does poorly**: It covers fewer exercises than ideal (only 3, compared to the prompt's emphasis on multiple interactive opportunities), and the applications section is somewhat brief without dedicated exercises. While it uses the slides effectively, it doesn't delve as deeply into practical frameworks or tie back to as many Stanford elements (e.g., dispositions or detailed processes) as it could. The tone is instructional but less expansive and motivational than others, potentially making it less engaging for sustained learning.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1. Response C\n2. Response D\n3.

It synthesizes the most effective elements of the proposed models, utilizing the provided \"Home Rui Robot\" pitch deck as a central case study and drawing upon the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for foundational accuracy.\n\n***\n\n# Critical Thinking Mastery: A Comprehensive Training Module\n\n**Instructor:** The LLM Council AI\n**Time Estimate:** Self-paced\n**Prerequisites:** Open-mindedness and a willingness to question.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc5 Module Roadmap\nThis training is designed to move you from theory to practice. We will treat the **Home Rui Robot** pitch deck as a real-world artifact for analysis.\n\n1.  **Foundations**: What is Critical Thinking?\n2.  **Core Concept 1**: Identifying Assumptions\n3.  **Core Concept 2**: Evaluating Evidence\n4.  **Core Concept 3**: Recognizing Biases & Fallacies\n5.  **Core Concept 4**: Constructing Sound Arguments\n6.  **Practical Applications**: Decision-Making Frameworks\n\n*Note: This module is presented in a step-by-step format. To get the most out of it, please pause at every **[EXERCISE]** prompt and formulate your answer before reading the subsequent critique.*\n\n---\n\n## 1. Foundations: What is Critical Thinking?\n\nAccording to the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*, critical thinking is not just about being negative or argumentative; it is **\"careful thinking directed to a goal.\"**\n\nIt requires two main components:\n1.  **Abilities**: The skills to analyze, infer, and evaluate.\n2.  **Dispositions**: The *willingness* to inquire, to suspend judgment, and to seek the truth even when it contradicts your current beliefs.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nIn an age of \"multi-trillion-dollar opportunities\" and \"AI hype,\" critical thinking is your defense against manipulation and your tool for making autonomy-preserving decisions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Core Concept 1: Identifying Assumptions\n\n### The Concept\nAn **assumption** is a belief accepted as true or certain to happen, without proof. Every plan, pitch, or argument rests on a foundation of implicit assumptions. If the foundation is weak, the structure collapses.\n*   **Explicit Premise**: \"We have built 5 working robots.\" (Stated Fact)\n*   **Implicit Assumption**: \"Seniors will be comfortable interacting with these robots daily.\" (Unstated Belief)\n\n### [EXERCISE 1]: The \"Every Home\" Assumption\n**Context:** Slide 14 of the Home Rui Robot presentation states: *\"We believe every home will need and want a care robot to reduce home risk factors for their aging parents.\"*\n\n**Your Task:**\nIdentify **three implicit assumptions** that must be true for this statement to hold water. Consider the financial, psychological, and technical aspects implicitly relied upon.\n\n**[STOP: Write your response before scrolling down.]**\n.\n.\n.\n### Instructor's Analysis (Concept 1)\nDid you spot these common assumptions?\n1.  **Financial Assumption**: That \"every home\" can afford a $1,000 setup fee plus $100/month (Slide 11).\n2.  **Psychological Assumption**: That seniors (and their families) accept a non-human entity as a solution to \"loneliness,\" rather than viewing it as a surveillance advice or a poor substitute for family.\n3.  **Technical Assumption**: That the \"Multimodal Edge AI\" (Slide 7) is sufficiently advanced to handle the complex, unpredictable nature of dementia care without causing harm or frustration.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core Concept 2: Evaluating Evidence\n\n### The Concept\nEvidence is the data used to support a claim. Critical thinkers evaluate evidence based on:\n*   **Relevance**: Does it actually support the specific conclusion?\n*   **Source Credibility**: Is the source biased? Is it an expert?\n*   **Sufficiency**: Is there enough evidence to generalize?\n\n### [EXERCISE 2]: The Loneliness\u2013Robot Connection\n**Context:** The pitch deck uses Slide 2 to establish a problem: *\"Loneliness and social isolation increase the risk of dementia by 50%... equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes each day.\"* (Source: ConsumerAffairs).\nThe solution proposed is the Care Social Companion (Slide 3).\n\n**Your Task:**\nEvaluate the evidence provided in the deck. Does the evidence on Slide 2 prove that the *robot* will solve the problem? Why or why not? Beware of the gap between the *problem evidence* and the *solution evidence*.\n\n**[STOP: Write your critique before scrolling down.]**\n.\n.\n.\n### Instructor's Analysis (Concept 2)\nA critical evaluation reveals a gap in the logic:\n*   The evidence provided (Slide 2) strongly supports the claim that **loneliness is a health risk**.\n*   However, the presentation implies a connection to the solution without direct evidence. Just because loneliness causes dementia does not mean a *robot* (specifically this robot) reduces loneliness.\n*   **Missing Evidence**: The deck mentions \"1 Robot Deployed at UCI\" and \"2nd Robot... at Case Western\" (Slide 13). A critical thinker would ask: *Where is the data from these deployments showing reduced cortisol levels or improved reported happiness?* Currently, the evidence supports the *problem*, not the *solution*.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Core Concept 3: Recognizing Biases & Fallacies\n\n### The Concept\nCognitive biases and logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that distort our judgment.\n*   **Optimism Bias**: Overestimating favorable outcomes (e.g., predicting \"hyper-scale\" sales in 2 years).\n*   **Appeal to Authority**: Believing something solely because an expert says so.\n*   **False Dilemma**: Presenting only two options when more exist.\n\n### [EXERCISE 3]: Spotting the Fallacy\n**Context:** Consider the logic presented in Slide 15: *\"Care social robots don't substitute for the human being\u2014they help when no one else is there to help.\"* combined with the Slide 14 claim of a *\"multi-trillion-dollar opportunity.\"*\n\n**Your Task:**\nImagine you are an investor. You feel an urgency to invest because you don't want to miss out on this \"trillion-dollar\" wave.\n1.  What **cognitive bias** are you experiencing?\n2.  Review Slide 14. Is there a **Logical Fallacy** in claiming that because \"Physical AI\" is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, *this specific* robot company will be successful?\n\n**[STOP: Write your analysis before scrolling down.]**\n.\n.\n.\n### Instructor's Analysis (Concept 3)\n1.  **Cognitive Bias**: This is **FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)** or the **Bandwagon Effect**. The slide frames the market as so massive that you feel irrational pressure to join, regardless of the specific product's merit.\n2.  **Logical Fallacy**: This is the **Fallacy of Division** (assuming what is true of the whole is true of the part). Just because the *Physical AI industry* is growing does not mean *Navigait* (the specific company) will capture that value. It also borders on a **Non Sequitur**; the success of the general industry does not logically guarantee the success of this specific localized robot.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Core Concept 4: Constructing Sound Arguments\n\n### The Concept\nA sound argument consists of true premises that logically guarantee a conclusion. It moves beyond \"opinion\" to \"reasoned judgment.\"\n\n**Structure:**\n*   Premise 1 (Fact)\n*   Premise 2 (Fact/Rule)\n*   Conclusion (Therefore...)\n\n### [EXERCISE 4]: The Investment Decision\n**Context:** You have $5.5M to allocate. You must make a definitive argument **FOR** or **AGAINST** funding the Seed Round described in Slide 13.\n\n**Your Task:**\nConstruct a sound argument.\n*   Avoid saying \"I feel like...\"\n*   Use the format: \"Because [Premise 1] and [Premise 2], [Conclusion].\"\n\n**[STOP: Formulate your argument before scrolling down.]**\n.\n.\n.\n### Instructor's Analysis (Concept 4)\nHere are examples of sound arguments (valid logic) based on different interpretations of the facts:\n\n**Argument FOR Investment:**\n*   **Premise 1**: The aging population is growing, creating a supply shortage of human caregivers (Slide 14).\n*   **Premise 2**: Navigait has successfully built 5 working prototypes and secured research partnerships with reputable universities (Slide 13).\n*   **Conclusion**: Therefore, Navigait has demonstrated technical feasibility and market fit aimed at a growing, unserved demographic, justifying a seed investment.\n\n**Argument AGAINST Investment:**\n*   **Premise 1**: The business model relies on reaching \"Hyper-scale\" by 2028 through government payers (Medicare/Medicaid) to be profitable (Slide 11).\n*   **Premise 2**: Medicare approval cycles typically take years of clinical validation, which is not accounted for in the 12-month pilot timeline (Slide 11/13).\n*   **Conclusion**: Therefore, the Go-to-Market strategy is unrealistic within the funding runway, making the investment too risky.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Practical Applications\n\nHow do you take these skills out of the classroom?\n\n### Application A: Decision Making\nWhen facing a complex decision (e.g., \"Should I buy this robot for my father?\"):\n1.  **Define the Problem**: Is the problem safety (falls) or loneliness? (The robot treats them differently).\n2.  **List Alternatives**: Robot ($100/mo) vs. Human Visitor ($25/hr) vs. Pet vs. Tablet Video Calls.\n3.  **Check Assumptions**: *Am I assuming Dad wants a robot? Am I assuming the robot works 100% of the time?*\n\n### Application B: Analyzing Information (The Dewey Method)\nWhen you see a news headline or a pitch:\n1.  **Feel the perplexity**: What doesn't add up? (e.g., \"Why is the projected revenue so high with only 100 pilot units?\")\n2.  **Define the difficulty**: \"The numbers imply a conversion rate that seems impatient.\"\n3.  **Test the hypothesis**: Look for comparable company growth rates. If they don't match, skepticism is warranted.\n\n---\n\n## Final Review\nYou have learned to:\n*   Identify hidden **assumptions** (financial, psychological).\n*   Critique **evidence** (separating problem data from solution data).\n*   Spot **biases** (market hype).\n*   Build **sound arguments** using premises.\n\n**Your Takeaway Challenge:**\nFor the next 24 hours, identify one assumption in every meeting or news article you read. Ask yourself: *\"What must be true for this statement to be correct?\"*"
