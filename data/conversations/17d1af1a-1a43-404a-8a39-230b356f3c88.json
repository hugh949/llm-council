Please use the picture of the \nrobot shared here so you can use the same picture to build your visual \nmodels of the robot as part of the screen play instructions for video \ngeneration step.\nThe goal of the robot is to provide social engagement to older adults \nusing best practices of Reminiscence Therapy, Validation Therapy and \nCognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) in a socially engaging manner that \nolder adults find interesting and useful.\nThe goal of social interactions is to build a trusting companion \nrelationship between the older adult and the robot by ensuring that \nrobot demonstrates active listening, empathic responses and memory \nrecall that shows that the robot cares, remembers and can be a useful \nassistant when it comes to remembering important daily life and family \nrelated events.\nThese are very distant topics for our Robotics & AI engineers so I want \nto create short animated videos that gives them clear demonstration of \n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nthe body language of the robot that clearly shows the interaction ability \nof the robot using its multimodal capabilities of vision, speech, \nlanguage, facial expressions on screen, screen tilt pan movements to \nmaintain eye contact, attention and focus on the human.\nMore specially, I want to start by creating animated videos of the \nfollowing use case scenarios:\nRobot is listening to what is being said by the older adults with \nthe dynamic on-screen facial expressions and body language \nthat show care and empathy.\nRobot is thinking so that the older adult knows that it will be few \nseconds before the robot responds so perhaps he/she should \nlet robot finish. Robot should express how long it needs every 5 \nseconds so that the wait is not endless for the older adult.\nRobot talks only when it knows it is not going to interrupt the \nolder adults by using its ability to see, listen and observe the \nbody language of the older adult. Here the focus is on robot \nunderstand the body language of the older adults and them \ndeciding its own social interaction.\nDuring active listening, robot should show relevant facial \nexpressions that shows its level of understand and when \nresponding it should have an appropriate tone, pitch that \nmatches the content and context of the conversation.\nOne of the goal of the interactions is to demonstrate the context \nspecific memory recall of the robot based on past interactions.\nDemonstrate robot initiative interactions when it feels it is \nnecessary to engage to continue the flow of conversation and \nalso when it feels, based in situational awareness, that human \ncan benefit for some cognitive social engagement.\nTo enable proactive robot initiative conversations, it is important \nthat robot should observe the body language of the older adults \nto make sure it is does not interrupt the older adult when he/she \nwas about to talk. Perhaps that person has the facial expression \nof thinking and reflecting before talking and so the robot should \nshow expression that is is waiting to listen more.\nOlder adults speak slowly and sometimes they have uttered only \nfew incomplete words and are searching for words to complete \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\u2013\n\u2013\nthe sentence. In such moments, robot should use the words and \nthe expression uttered by human to determine whether or not \nthe words make up a complete thought or not so that it can \nproceed to process and move to a response state or just wait for \nthe human to complete rest of the sentence. This can be shown \nthrough active listening body language of the robot that it is \nhappy to wait and let the older adult speak on his/her own speed \nand terms without feeling rushed or ignored.\nShow key facial expressions of the robot along with body \nlanguage that shows thinking, listening, wanting to talk using \non-screen expressions and physical body language of the robot. \nAdd additional necessary and relevant expressions that will \nallow for smooth human robot interaction without frustration on \nthe part of the older adult. The expressions should be easy to \nunderstand, consistent and useful in making the human robot \ninteraction related user experience smooth, graceful, elegant \nand friendly.\nPlease come up with other use cases along these line as well that you \nfeel are more relevant and will explain the unique value propositions of \nour human-robot interaction capabilities when socially engaging with \nolder adults, especially with those who might be experiencing mild \ncognitive decline. Give each use case a clear and compelling title that \nshow the purpose and the value proposition that will be demonstrated.\nI want to be able to make the interaction more predictable for the older \nadult so they are not frustrated by the robot in terms of not know when \nrobot will respond, when they can interrupt the robot, when and why the \nrobot interrupted them.\nAlso, since the whole interaction is about listening and making the older \nadults share and talk, I want to robot\u2019s responses to be relevant, useful \nand short so that all the airtime is not taken up by the robot.\nAny words that robot utters should be carefully and respectfully reflect \nthat core principles and ideas I have expressed about on the role and \n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\npurpose of the robot.\nPlease give me all the steps that are necessary to create 10 to 20 \nsecond animate interaction between the robot and the older adult. For \nthese one-on-one HRI sessions please use the robot that we have \ndesigned that has some of the hardware and AI capabilities to enable \nthe necessary user experiences described above.\nWe don\u2019t the hardware or AI limitations but rather creative imagination \nlimitations to show what is possible to build engaging and trusting \nhuman robot care interactions with older adults. The social robot does \nnot have actual arms and legs (it is not a humanoid) so don\u2019t use them \nin the screenplay creation.\nI want to use the best video generation tools available so create the \nrelevant story and scenes that will make it easy for the modern AI video \ngeneration tools to process so these tools can take your generated \nscreenplay and create compelling short videos that make specific point \nthat helps the AI and robotics hardware engineers get the technical \nspecifications they need to build working demos and prototypes that \ncan be used for user, customer, and expert validation.\nMake sure each screenplay is for a 5 to 10 second video snippet and \nfocuses on a single feature and capability that will be highly useful and \ndesirable by older adults and will lead to the patient outcomes that we \nwant to demonstrate through social engagement with older adults \nespecially those experiencing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety or \nother mild issues related to memory recall and remembering common \ndaily life activities and events in their lives.\nThe goals of the small videos we want to create are multiple including:\nValidate the use case scenario with experts in HCI, HRI, social \ntherapies like Reminiscence Therapy, Validation Therapy and \nCognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).\nValidate the interaction with actual order adults, care givers for \nusefulness and relevance of the use case.\nGive AI and Robotics technical teams clear mission and purpose, \n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\u2013\nin visual form, so they understand what functional demo and \nprototype they need to build to demonstrate the technical \ncapabilities of the social robot.\nPlease review these instructions again and do deep research on the \nindustry best practices of social robots that are underway in the \ncompetitive landscape, research community and research labs and them \nthink of how best to create the screenplays that become the basis for \nmy using the video generation tools to build the short videos to \nmeetings and goals and objectives stated throughout this message and \nspecific instructions I have outlined.\nChatGPT RESPONSE\nBelow is a practical \u201cHRI micro-video kit\u201d you can hand to engineers \nand also use with AI video generators. It\u2019s built around industry \npatterns for socially assistive robots (SARs) for older adults \n(predictability, transparency, autonomy, emotional safety, short robot \ntalk-time).  \nI\u2019ll do four things:\n1. Define a shared interaction language (expressions + \nmotion cues) for your specific robot form factor (screen-face + \nhead tilt/pan + base).\n2. Give you end-to-end steps to produce 5\u201310s clips with \nmodern AI video tools using your robot image as the reference.  \n3. Provide 12 ready-to-generate screenplay snippets (each \nfocuses on ONE capability; all robot lines are short, respectful, \nand therapy-aligned).\n4.

What each state looks like on your robot (screen + head + base)\nBecause you don\u2019t have arms/legs, you\u2019ll communicate via:\n\u2022 Screen face: eyes, eyebrows, mouth; optional small icons (ear / \ndots / lightbulb / heart).\n\u2022 Head tilt/pan: micro-motions to show attention and turn-\ntaking.\n\u2022 Base posture: tiny forward lean (roll forward 2\u20135 cm), tiny \nback-off (roll back), gentle re-centering.\n\u2022 Audio micro-cues: a soft \u201cmm-hm\u201d / \u201cokay\u201d only when needed \n(avoid interrupting).\n\u2022 Timing rules: predictable pauses matter more than fancy \nexpressions.\nA very effective pattern used in real products is proactive but \nautonomy-respecting companionship (nudge, don\u2019t nag), and clear \ncommunication about what the system is doing.  \nC.

Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n1.

History\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\nSupplement on Assessment\n.\nEducational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\nFor details on this history, see the\nSupplement on History\n.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\nTransit\n: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down\non a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I\nreturned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway\nexpress. But was there a station near? If not, I might lose more than\ntwenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and\nI saw there was such a line within two blocks. But where was the\nstation? If it were several blocks above or below the street I was on,\nI should lose time instead of gaining it. My mind went back to the\nsubway express as quicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered\nthat it went nearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I\nwished to reach, so that time would be saved at the end of the\njourney. I concluded in favor of the subway, and reached my\ndestination by one o\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369;\n1933: 91\u201392)\nFerryboat\n: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of\nthe boat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he\nwould need some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also\nneed poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more\nprobable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion\nthat the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the\ndirection in which the boat pointed, to enable him to steer\ncorrectly.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\nBubbles\n: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\nWeather\n: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\nDisorder\n: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\nTyphoid\n: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\nBlur\n: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\nSuction pump\n: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\nDiamond\n: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\nRash\n: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\nCandidate\n: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\nsuggestions\n, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem\nto be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis\n, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (\nreasoning\n, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\nTransit\nmight have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\nTyphoid\nas avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\nObserving\n: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\nWeather\n,\nbubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\nBubbles\n,\na moving blur in the distance in\nBlur\n,\na rash in\nRash\n).\nOr one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\nDisorder\n,\nno suction without air pressure in\nSuction pump\n)\nFeeling\n: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\nTransit\n,\nwhy the diamonds vary in spacing in\nDiamond\n).\nOne wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit\n, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond\n).\nWondering\n: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nhow suction pumps work in\nSuction pump\n,\nwhat caused the rash in\nRash\n).\nImagining\n: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\nTransit\n,\nflagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\nFerryboat\n,\nallergic reaction or heat rash in\nRash\n).\nInferring\n: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\nearlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\nRash\n).\nOr one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\nTransit\n,\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\ndiscontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\nRash\n).\nKnowledge\n: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\nTransit\n,\nof the requirements for a flagpole in\nFerryboat\n,\nof Boyle\u2019s law in\nBubbles\n,\nof allergic reactions in\nRash\n).\nExperimenting\n: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\nFerryboat\n,\nputting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nmeasuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\nSuction pump\n,\nnoticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\nDiamond\n).\nConsulting\n: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\nCandidate\nincludes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments\n: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\nCandidate\n.\nIt is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging\n: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\nFerryboat\nthat the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding\n: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\nTransit\nto take the subway.\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\nAttentiveness\n: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\nWeather\nwould not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry\n: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\nBubbles\ncould easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence\n: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\nRash\nlacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage\n: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness\n: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment\n: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason\n: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth\n: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\nSupplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions\n.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\nTransit\n,\nhas some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\nsection 6\nas components of the critical thinking process described in\nsection 5\n.\nThe derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\nObservational abilities\n: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9).

Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n1.

History\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\nSupplement on Assessment\n.\nEducational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\nFor details on this history, see the\nSupplement on History\n.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\nTransit\n: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down\non a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I\nreturned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway\nexpress. But was there a station near? If not, I might lose more than\ntwenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and\nI saw there was such a line within two blocks. But where was the\nstation? If it were several blocks above or below the street I was on,\nI should lose time instead of gaining it. My mind went back to the\nsubway express as quicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered\nthat it went nearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I\nwished to reach, so that time would be saved at the end of the\njourney. I concluded in favor of the subway, and reached my\ndestination by one o\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369;\n1933: 91\u201392)\nFerryboat\n: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of\nthe boat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he\nwould need some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also\nneed poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more\nprobable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion\nthat the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the\ndirection in which the boat pointed, to enable him to steer\ncorrectly.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\nBubbles\n: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\nWeather\n: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\nDisorder\n: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\nTyphoid\n: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\nBlur\n: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\nSuction pump\n: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\nDiamond\n: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\nRash\n: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\nCandidate\n: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\nsuggestions\n, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem\nto be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis\n, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (\nreasoning\n, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\nTransit\nmight have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\nTyphoid\nas avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\nObserving\n: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\nWeather\n,\nbubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\nBubbles\n,\na moving blur in the distance in\nBlur\n,\na rash in\nRash\n).\nOr one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\nDisorder\n,\nno suction without air pressure in\nSuction pump\n)\nFeeling\n: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\nTransit\n,\nwhy the diamonds vary in spacing in\nDiamond\n).\nOne wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit\n, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond\n).\nWondering\n: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nhow suction pumps work in\nSuction pump\n,\nwhat caused the rash in\nRash\n).\nImagining\n: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\nTransit\n,\nflagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\nFerryboat\n,\nallergic reaction or heat rash in\nRash\n).\nInferring\n: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\nearlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\nRash\n).\nOr one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\nTransit\n,\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\ndiscontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\nRash\n).\nKnowledge\n: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\nTransit\n,\nof the requirements for a flagpole in\nFerryboat\n,\nof Boyle\u2019s law in\nBubbles\n,\nof allergic reactions in\nRash\n).\nExperimenting\n: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\nFerryboat\n,\nputting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nmeasuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\nSuction pump\n,\nnoticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\nDiamond\n).\nConsulting\n: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\nCandidate\nincludes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments\n: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\nCandidate\n.\nIt is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging\n: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\nFerryboat\nthat the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding\n: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\nTransit\nto take the subway.\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\nAttentiveness\n: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\nWeather\nwould not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry\n: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\nBubbles\ncould easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence\n: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\nRash\nlacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage\n: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness\n: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment\n: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason\n: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth\n: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\nSupplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions\n.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\nTransit\n,\nhas some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\nsection 6\nas components of the critical thinking process described in\nsection 5\n.\nThe derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\nObservational abilities\n: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9). There\nare items testing a person\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of\nobservation reports in the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests, Levels X\nand Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005). Norris and King (1983, 1985, 1990a, 1990b) is a test of ability\nto appraise observation reports.\nEmotional abilities\n: The emotions that drive a critical\nthinking process are perplexity or puzzlement, a wish to resolve it,\nand satisfaction at a",

Please use the picture of the \nrobot shared here so you can use the same picture to build your visual \nmodels of the robot as part of the screen play instructions for video \ngeneration step.\nThe goal of the robot is to provide social engagement to older adults \nusing best practices of Reminiscence Therapy, Validation Therapy and \nCognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) in a socially engaging manner that \nolder adults find interesting and useful.\nThe goal of social interactions is to build a trusting companion \nrelationship between the older adult and the robot by ensuring that \nrobot demonstrates active listening, empathic responses and memory \nrecall that shows that the robot cares, remembers and can be a useful \nassistant when it comes to remembering important daily life and family \nrelated events.\nThese are very distant topics for our Robotics & AI engineers so I want \nto create short animated videos that gives them clear demonstration of \n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nthe body language of the robot that clearly shows the interaction ability \nof the robot using its multimodal capabilities of vision, speech, \nlanguage, facial expressions on screen, screen tilt pan movements to \nmaintain eye contact, attention and focus on the human.\nMore specially, I want to start by creating animated videos of the \nfollowing use case scenarios:\nRobot is listening to what is being said by the older adults with \nthe dynamic on-screen facial expressions and body language \nthat show care and empathy.\nRobot is thinking so that the older adult knows that it will be few \nseconds before the robot responds so perhaps he/she should \nlet robot finish. Robot should express how long it needs every 5 \nseconds so that the wait is not endless for the older adult.\nRobot talks only when it knows it is not going to interrupt the \nolder adults by using its ability to see, listen and observe the \nbody language of the older adult. Here the focus is on robot \nunderstand the body language of the older adults and them \ndeciding its own social interaction.\nDuring active listening, robot should show relevant facial \nexpressions that shows its level of understand and when \nresponding it should have an appropriate tone, pitch that \nmatches the content and context of the conversation.\nOne of the goal of the interactions is to demonstrate the context \nspecific memory recall of the robot based on past interactions.\nDemonstrate robot initiative interactions when it feels it is \nnecessary to engage to continue the flow of conversation and \nalso when it feels, based in situational awareness, that human \ncan benefit for some cognitive social engagement.\nTo enable proactive robot initiative conversations, it is important \nthat robot should observe the body language of the older adults \nto make sure it is does not interrupt the older adult when he/she \nwas about to talk. Perhaps that person has the facial expression \nof thinking and reflecting before talking and so the robot should \nshow expression that is is waiting to listen more.\nOlder adults speak slowly and sometimes they have uttered only \nfew incomplete words and are searching for words to complete \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\u2013\n\u2013\nthe sentence. In such moments, robot should use the words and \nthe expression uttered by human to determine whether or not \nthe words make up a complete thought or not so that it can \nproceed to process and move to a response state or just wait for \nthe human to complete rest of the sentence. This can be shown \nthrough active listening body language of the robot that it is \nhappy to wait and let the older adult speak on his/her own speed \nand terms without feeling rushed or ignored.\nShow key facial expressions of the robot along with body \nlanguage that shows thinking, listening, wanting to talk using \non-screen expressions and physical body language of the robot. \nAdd additional necessary and relevant expressions that will \nallow for smooth human robot interaction without frustration on \nthe part of the older adult. The expressions should be easy to \nunderstand, consistent and useful in making the human robot \ninteraction related user experience smooth, graceful, elegant \nand friendly.\nPlease come up with other use cases along these line as well that you \nfeel are more relevant and will explain the unique value propositions of \nour human-robot interaction capabilities when socially engaging with \nolder adults, especially with those who might be experiencing mild \ncognitive decline. Give each use case a clear and compelling title that \nshow the purpose and the value proposition that will be demonstrated.\nI want to be able to make the interaction more predictable for the older \nadult so they are not frustrated by the robot in terms of not know when \nrobot will respond, when they can interrupt the robot, when and why the \nrobot interrupted them.\nAlso, since the whole interaction is about listening and making the older \nadults share and talk, I want to robot\u2019s responses to be relevant, useful \nand short so that all the airtime is not taken up by the robot.\nAny words that robot utters should be carefully and respectfully reflect \nthat core principles and ideas I have expressed about on the role and \n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\npurpose of the robot.\nPlease give me all the steps that are necessary to create 10 to 20 \nsecond animate interaction between the robot and the older adult.

Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n1.

History\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\nSupplement on Assessment\n.\nEducational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\nFor details on this history, see the\nSupplement on History\n.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\nTransit\n: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down\non a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I\nreturned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway\nexpress. But was there a station near? If not, I might lose more than\ntwenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and\nI saw there was such a line within two blocks. But where was the\nstation? If it were several blocks above or below the street I was on,\nI should lose time instead of gaining it. My mind went back to the\nsubway express as quicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered\nthat it went nearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I\nwished to reach, so that time would be saved at the end of the\njourney. I concluded in favor of the subway, and reached my\ndestination by one o\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369;\n1933: 91\u201392)\nFerryboat\n: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of\nthe boat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he\nwould need some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also\nneed poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more\nprobable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion\nthat the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the\ndirection in which the boat pointed, to enable him to steer\ncorrectly.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\nBubbles\n: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\nWeather\n: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\nDisorder\n: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\nTyphoid\n: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\nBlur\n: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\nSuction pump\n: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\nDiamond\n: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\nRash\n: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\nCandidate\n: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\nsuggestions\n, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem\nto be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis\n, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (\nreasoning\n, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\nTransit\nmight have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\nTyphoid\nas avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\nObserving\n: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\nWeather\n,\nbubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\nBubbles\n,\na moving blur in the distance in\nBlur\n,\na rash in\nRash\n).\nOr one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\nDisorder\n,\nno suction without air pressure in\nSuction pump\n)\nFeeling\n: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\nTransit\n,\nwhy the diamonds vary in spacing in\nDiamond\n).\nOne wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit\n, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond\n).\nWondering\n: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nhow suction pumps work in\nSuction pump\n,\nwhat caused the rash in\nRash\n).\nImagining\n: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\nTransit\n,\nflagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\nFerryboat\n,\nallergic reaction or heat rash in\nRash\n).\nInferring\n: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\nearlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\nRash\n).\nOr one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\nTransit\n,\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\ndiscontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\nRash\n).\nKnowledge\n: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\nTransit\n,\nof the requirements for a flagpole in\nFerryboat\n,\nof Boyle\u2019s law in\nBubbles\n,\nof allergic reactions in\nRash\n).\nExperimenting\n: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\nFerryboat\n,\nputting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nmeasuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\nSuction pump\n,\nnoticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\nDiamond\n).\nConsulting\n: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\nCandidate\nincludes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments\n: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\nCandidate\n.\nIt is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging\n: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\nFerryboat\nthat the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding\n: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\nTransit\nto take the subway.\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\nAttentiveness\n: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\nWeather\nwould not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry\n: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\nBubbles\ncould easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence\n: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\nRash\nlacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage\n: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness\n: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment\n: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason\n: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth\n: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\nSupplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions\n.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\nTransit\n,\nhas some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\nsection 6\nas components of the critical thinking process described in\nsection 5\n.\nThe derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\nObservational abilities\n: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9). There\nare items testing a person\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of\nobservation reports in the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests, Levels X\nand Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005). Norris and King (1983, 1985, 1990a, 1990b) is a test of ability\nto appraise observation reports.\nEmotional abilities\n: The emotions that drive a critical\nthinking process are perplexity or puzzlement, a wish to resolve it,\nand satisfaction at a\n\n### https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-thinking/\n\nCritical Thinking (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\nMenu\nBrowse\nTable of Contents\nWhat's New\nRandom Entry\nChronological\nArchives\nAbout\nEditorial Information\nAbout the SEP\nEditorial Board\nHow to Cite the SEP\nSpecial Characters\nAdvanced Tools\nContact\nSupport SEP\nSupport the SEP\nPDFs for SEP Friends\nMake a Donation\nSEPIA for Libraries\nEntry Navigation\nEntry Contents\nBibliography\nAcademic Tools\nFriends PDF Preview\nAuthor and Citation Info\nBack to Top\nCritical Thinking\nFirst published Sat Jul 21, 2018; substantive revision Wed Oct 12, 2022\nCritical thinking is a widely accepted educational goal. Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n1.

History\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\nSupplement on Assessment\n.\nEducational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\nFor details on this history, see the\nSupplement on History\n.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\nTransit\n: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down\non a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I\nreturned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway\nexpress. But was there a station near? If not, I might lose more than\ntwenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and\nI saw there was such a line within two blocks. But where was the\nstation? If it were several blocks above or below the street I was on,\nI should lose time instead of gaining it. My mind went back to the\nsubway express as quicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered\nthat it went nearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I\nwished to reach, so that time would be saved at the end of the\njourney. I concluded in favor of the subway, and reached my\ndestination by one o\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369;\n1933: 91\u201392)\nFerryboat\n: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of\nthe boat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he\nwould need some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also\nneed poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more\nprobable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion\nthat the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the\ndirection in which the boat pointed, to enable him to steer\ncorrectly.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\nBubbles\n: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\nWeather\n: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\nDisorder\n: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\nTyphoid\n: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\nBlur\n: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\nSuction pump\n: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\nDiamond\n: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\nRash\n: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\nCandidate\n: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\nsuggestions\n, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem\nto be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis\n, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (\nreasoning\n, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\nTransit\nmight have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\nTyphoid\nas avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\nObserving\n: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\nWeather\n,\nbubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\nBubbles\n,\na moving blur in the distance in\nBlur\n,\na rash in\nRash\n).\nOr one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\nDisorder\n,\nno suction without air pressure in\nSuction pump\n)\nFeeling\n: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\nTransit\n,\nwhy the diamonds vary in spacing in\nDiamond\n).\nOne wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit\n, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond\n).\nWondering\n: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nhow suction pumps work in\nSuction pump\n,\nwhat caused the rash in\nRash\n).\nImagining\n: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\nTransit\n,\nflagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\nFerryboat\n,\nallergic reaction or heat rash in\nRash\n).\nInferring\n: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\nearlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\nRash\n).\nOr one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\nTransit\n,\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\ndiscontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\nRash\n).\nKnowledge\n: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\nTransit\n,\nof the requirements for a flagpole in\nFerryboat\n,\nof Boyle\u2019s law in\nBubbles\n,\nof allergic reactions in\nRash\n).\nExperimenting\n: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\nFerryboat\n,\nputting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nmeasuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\nSuction pump\n,\nnoticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\nDiamond\n).\nConsulting\n: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\nCandidate\nincludes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments\n: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\nCandidate\n.\nIt is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging\n: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\nFerryboat\nthat the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding\n: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\nTransit\nto take the subway.\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\nAttentiveness\n: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\nWeather\nwould not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry\n: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\nBubbles\ncould easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence\n: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\nRash\nlacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage\n: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness\n: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment\n: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason\n: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth\n: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\nSupplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions\n.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\nTransit\n,\nhas some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\nsection 6\nas components of the critical thinking process described in\nsection 5\n.\nThe derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\nObservational abilities\n: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9). There\nare items testing a person\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of\nobservation reports in the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests, Levels X\nand Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005). Norris and King (1983, 1985, 1990a, 1990b) is a test of ability\nto appraise observation reports.\nEmotional abilities\n: The emotions that drive a critical\nthinking process are perplexity or puzzlement, a wish to resolve it,\nand satisfaction at a\n\n\n\n---\n\nThe council should use all of this context when addressing the prompt above.

Please use the picture of the \nrobot shared here so you can use the same picture to build your visual \nmodels of the robot as part of the screen play instructions for video \ngeneration step.\nThe goal of the robot is to provide social engagement to older adults \nusing best practices of Reminiscence Therapy, Validation Therapy and \nCognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) in a socially engaging manner that \nolder adults find interesting and useful.\nThe goal of social interactions is to build a trusting companion \nrelationship between the older adult and the robot by ensuring that \nrobot demonstrates active listening, empathic responses and memory \nrecall that shows that the robot cares, remembers and can be a useful \nassistant when it comes to remembering important daily life and family \nrelated events.\nThese are very distant topics for our Robotics & AI engineers so I want \nto create short animated videos that gives them clear demonstration of \n\n--- Page 2 ---\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nthe body language of the robot that clearly shows the interaction ability \nof the robot using its multimodal capabilities of vision, speech, \nlanguage, facial expressions on screen, screen tilt pan movements to \nmaintain eye contact, attention and focus on the human.\nMore specially, I want to start by creating animated videos of the \nfollowing use case scenarios:\nRobot is listening to what is being said by the older adults with \nthe dynamic on-screen facial expressions and body language \nthat show care and empathy.\nRobot is thinking so that the older adult knows that it will be few \nseconds before the robot responds so perhaps he/she should \nlet robot finish. Robot should express how long it needs every 5 \nseconds so that the wait is not endless for the older adult.\nRobot talks only when it knows it is not going to interrupt the \nolder adults by using its ability to see, listen and observe the \nbody language of the older adult. Here the focus is on robot \nunderstand the body language of the older adults and them \ndeciding its own social interaction.\nDuring active listening, robot should show relevant facial \nexpressions that shows its level of understand and when \nresponding it should have an appropriate tone, pitch that \nmatches the content and context of the conversation.\nOne of the goal of the interactions is to demonstrate the context \nspecific memory recall of the robot based on past interactions.\nDemonstrate robot initiative interactions when it feels it is \nnecessary to engage to continue the flow of conversation and \nalso when it feels, based in situational awareness, that human \ncan benefit for some cognitive social engagement.\nTo enable proactive robot initiative conversations, it is important \nthat robot should observe the body language of the older adults \nto make sure it is does not interrupt the older adult when he/she \nwas about to talk. Perhaps that person has the facial expression \nof thinking and reflecting before talking and so the robot should \nshow expression that is is waiting to listen more.\nOlder adults speak slowly and sometimes they have uttered only \nfew incomplete words and are searching for words to complete \n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\u2013\n\u2013\nthe sentence. In such moments, robot should use the words and \nthe expression uttered by human to determine whether or not \nthe words make up a complete thought or not so that it can \nproceed to process and move to a response state or just wait for \nthe human to complete rest of the sentence. This can be shown \nthrough active listening body language of the robot that it is \nhappy to wait and let the older adult speak on his/her own speed \nand terms without feeling rushed or ignored.\nShow key facial expressions of the robot along with body \nlanguage that shows thinking, listening, wanting to talk using \non-screen expressions and physical body language of the robot. \nAdd additional necessary and relevant expressions that will \nallow for smooth human robot interaction without frustration on \nthe part of the older adult. The expressions should be easy to \nunderstand, consistent and useful in making the human robot \ninteraction related user experience smooth, graceful, elegant \nand friendly.\nPlease come up with other use cases along these line as well that you \nfeel are more relevant and will explain the unique value propositions of \nour human-robot interaction capabilities when socially engaging with \nolder adults, especially with those who might be experiencing mild \ncognitive decline. Give each use case a clear and compelling title that \nshow the purpose and the value proposition that will be demonstrated.\nI want to be able to make the interaction more predictable for the older \nadult so they are not frustrated by the robot in terms of not know when \nrobot will respond, when they can interrupt the robot, when and why the \nrobot interrupted them.\nAlso, since the whole interaction is about listening and making the older \nadults share and talk, I want to robot\u2019s responses to be relevant, useful \nand short so that all the airtime is not taken up by the robot.\nAny words that robot utters should be carefully and respectfully reflect \nthat core principles and ideas I have expressed about on the role and \n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\npurpose of the robot.\nPlease give me all the steps that are necessary to create 10 to 20 \nsecond animate interaction between the robot and the older adult. For \nthese one-on-one HRI sessions please use the robot that we have \ndesigned that has some of the hardware and AI capabilities to enable \nthe necessary user experiences described above.\nWe don\u2019t the hardware or AI limitations but rather creative imagination \nlimitations to show what is possible to build engaging and trusting \nhuman robot care interactions with older adults. The social robot does \nnot have actual arms and legs (it is not a humanoid) so don\u2019t use them \nin the screenplay creation.\nI want to use the best video generation tools available so create the \nrelevant story and scenes that will make it easy for the modern AI video \ngeneration tools to process so these tools can take your generated \nscreenplay and create compelling short videos that make specific point \nthat helps the AI and robotics hardware engineers get the technical \nspecifications they need to build working demos and prototypes that \ncan be used for user, customer, and expert validation.\nMake sure each screenplay is for a 5 to 10 second video snippet and \nfocuses on a single feature and capability that will be highly useful and \ndesirable by older adults and will lead to the patient outcomes that we \nwant to demonstrate through social engagement with older adults \nespecially those experiencing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety or \nother mild issues related to memory recall and remembering common \ndaily life activities and events in their lives.\nThe goals of the small videos we want to create are multiple including:\nValidate the use case scenario with experts in HCI, HRI, social \ntherapies like Reminiscence Therapy, Validation Therapy and \nCognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT).\nValidate the interaction with actual order adults, care givers for \nusefulness and relevance of the use case.\nGive AI and Robotics technical teams clear mission and purpose, \n\n--- Page 5 ---\n\u2013\nin visual form, so they understand what functional demo and \nprototype they need to build to demonstrate the technical \ncapabilities of the social robot.\nPlease review these instructions again and do deep research on the \nindustry best practices of social robots that are underway in the \ncompetitive landscape, research community and research labs and them \nthink of how best to create the screenplays that become the basis for \nmy using the video generation tools to build the short videos to \nmeetings and goals and objectives stated throughout this message and \nspecific instructions I have outlined.\nChatGPT RESPONSE\nBelow is a practical \u201cHRI micro-video kit\u201d you can hand to engineers \nand also use with AI video generators. It\u2019s built around industry \npatterns for socially assistive robots (SARs) for older adults \n(predictability, transparency, autonomy, emotional safety, short robot \ntalk-time).  \nI\u2019ll do four things:\n1. Define a shared interaction language (expressions + \nmotion cues) for your specific robot form factor (screen-face + \nhead tilt/pan + base).\n2. Give you end-to-end steps to produce 5\u201310s clips with \nmodern AI video tools using your robot image as the reference.  \n3. Provide 12 ready-to-generate screenplay snippets (each \nfocuses on ONE capability; all robot lines are short, respectful, \nand therapy-aligned).\n4.

Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n1.

History\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\nSupplement on Assessment\n.\nEducational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\nFor details on this history, see the\nSupplement on History\n.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\nTransit\n: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down\non a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I\nreturned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway\nexpress. But was there a station near? If not, I might lose more than\ntwenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and\nI saw there was such a line within two blocks. But where was the\nstation? If it were several blocks above or below the street I was on,\nI should lose time instead of gaining it. My mind went back to the\nsubway express as quicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered\nthat it went nearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I\nwished to reach, so that time would be saved at the end of the\njourney. I concluded in favor of the subway, and reached my\ndestination by one o\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369;\n1933: 91\u201392)\nFerryboat\n: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of\nthe boat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he\nwould need some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also\nneed poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more\nprobable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion\nthat the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the\ndirection in which the boat pointed, to enable him to steer\ncorrectly.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\nBubbles\n: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\nWeather\n: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\nDisorder\n: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\nTyphoid\n: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\nBlur\n: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\nSuction pump\n: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\nDiamond\n: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\nRash\n: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\nCandidate\n: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\nsuggestions\n, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem\nto be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis\n, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (\nreasoning\n, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\nTransit\nmight have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\nTyphoid\nas avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\nObserving\n: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\nWeather\n,\nbubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\nBubbles\n,\na moving blur in the distance in\nBlur\n,\na rash in\nRash\n).\nOr one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\nDisorder\n,\nno suction without air pressure in\nSuction pump\n)\nFeeling\n: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\nTransit\n,\nwhy the diamonds vary in spacing in\nDiamond\n).\nOne wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit\n, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond\n).\nWondering\n: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nhow suction pumps work in\nSuction pump\n,\nwhat caused the rash in\nRash\n).\nImagining\n: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\nTransit\n,\nflagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\nFerryboat\n,\nallergic reaction or heat rash in\nRash\n).\nInferring\n: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\nearlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\nRash\n).\nOr one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\nTransit\n,\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\ndiscontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\nRash\n).\nKnowledge\n: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\nTransit\n,\nof the requirements for a flagpole in\nFerryboat\n,\nof Boyle\u2019s law in\nBubbles\n,\nof allergic reactions in\nRash\n).\nExperimenting\n: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\nFerryboat\n,\nputting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nmeasuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\nSuction pump\n,\nnoticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\nDiamond\n).\nConsulting\n: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\nCandidate\nincludes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments\n: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\nCandidate\n.\nIt is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging\n: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\nFerryboat\nthat the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding\n: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\nTransit\nto take the subway.\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\nAttentiveness\n: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\nWeather\nwould not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry\n: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\nBubbles\ncould easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence\n: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\nRash\nlacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage\n: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness\n: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment\n: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason\n: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth\n: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\nSupplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions\n.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\nTransit\n,\nhas some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\nsection 6\nas components of the critical thinking process described in\nsection 5\n.\nThe derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\nObservational abilities\n: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9). There\nare items testing a person\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of\nobservation reports in the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests, Levels X\nand Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005).

Its\ndefinition is contested, but the competing definitions can be\nunderstood as differing conceptions of the same basic concept: careful\nthinking directed to a goal. Conceptions differ with respect to the\nscope of such thinking, the type of goal, the criteria and norms for\nthinking carefully, and the thinking components on which they focus.\nIts adoption as an educational goal has been recommended on the basis\nof respect for students\u2019 autonomy and preparing students for\nsuccess in life and for democratic citizenship. \u201cCritical\nthinkers\u201d have the dispositions and abilities that lead them to\nthink critically when appropriate. The abilities can be identified\ndirectly; the dispositions indirectly, by considering what factors\ncontribute to or impede exercise of the abilities. Standardized tests\nhave been developed to assess the degree to which a person possesses\nsuch dispositions and abilities. Educational intervention has been\nshown experimentally to improve them, particularly when it includes\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. Controversies have\narisen over the generalizability of critical thinking across domains,\nover alleged bias in critical thinking theories and instruction, and\nover the relationship of critical thinking to other types of\nthinking.\n1.

History\nUse of the term \u2018critical thinking\u2019 to describe an\neducational goal goes back to the American philosopher John Dewey\n(1910), who more commonly called it \u2018reflective thinking\u2019.\nHe defined it as\nactive, persistent and careful consideration of any belief or supposed\nform of knowledge in the light of the grounds that support it, and the\nfurther conclusions to which it tends. (Dewey 1910: 6; 1933: 9)\nand identified a habit of such consideration with a scientific\nattitude of mind. His lengthy quotations of Francis Bacon, John Locke,\nand John Stuart Mill indicate that he was not the first person to\npropose development of a scientific attitude of mind as an educational\ngoal.\nIn the 1930s, many of the schools that participated in the Eight-Year\nStudy of the Progressive Education Association (Aikin 1942) adopted\ncritical thinking as an educational goal, for whose achievement the\nstudy\u2019s Evaluation Staff developed tests (Smith, Tyler, &\nEvaluation Staff 1942). Glaser (1941) showed experimentally that it\nwas possible to improve the critical thinking of high school students.\nBloom\u2019s influential taxonomy of cognitive educational objectives\n(Bloom et al. 1956) incorporated critical thinking abilities. Ennis\n(1962) proposed 12 aspects of critical thinking as a basis for\nresearch on the teaching and evaluation of critical thinking\nability.\nSince 1980, an annual international conference in California on\ncritical thinking and educational reform has attracted tens of\nthousands of educators from all levels of education and from many\nparts of the world. Also since 1980, the state university system in\nCalifornia has required all undergraduate students to take a critical\nthinking course. Since 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and\nCritical Thinking has sponsored sessions in conjunction with the\ndivisional meetings of the American Philosophical Association (APA).\nIn 1987, the APA\u2019s Committee on Pre-College Philosophy\ncommissioned a consensus statement on critical thinking for purposes\nof educational assessment and instruction (Facione 1990a). Researchers\nhave developed standardized tests of critical thinking abilities and\ndispositions; for details, see the\nSupplement on Assessment\n.\nEducational jurisdictions around the world now include critical\nthinking in guidelines for curriculum and assessment.\nFor details on this history, see the\nSupplement on History\n.\n2. Examples and Non-Examples\nBefore considering the definition of critical thinking, it will be\nhelpful to have in mind some examples of critical thinking, as well as\nsome examples of kinds of thinking that would apparently not count as\ncritical thinking.\n2.1 Dewey\u2019s Three Main Examples\nDewey (1910: 68\u201371; 1933: 91\u201394) takes as paradigms of\nreflective thinking three class papers of students in which they\ndescribe their thinking. The examples range from the everyday to the\nscientific.\nTransit\n: \u201cThe other day, when I was down town on 16th\nStreet, a clock caught my eye. I saw that the hands pointed to 12:20.\nThis suggested that I had an engagement at 124th Street, at one\no\u2019clock. I reasoned that as it had taken me an hour to come down\non a surface car, I should probably be twenty minutes late if I\nreturned the same way. I might save twenty minutes by a subway\nexpress. But was there a station near? If not, I might lose more than\ntwenty minutes in looking for one. Then I thought of the elevated, and\nI saw there was such a line within two blocks. But where was the\nstation? If it were several blocks above or below the street I was on,\nI should lose time instead of gaining it. My mind went back to the\nsubway express as quicker than the elevated; furthermore, I remembered\nthat it went nearer than the elevated to the part of 124th Street I\nwished to reach, so that time would be saved at the end of the\njourney. I concluded in favor of the subway, and reached my\ndestination by one o\u2019clock.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 68\u201369;\n1933: 91\u201392)\nFerryboat\n: \u201cProjecting nearly horizontally from the\nupper deck of the ferryboat on which I daily cross the river is a long\nwhite pole, having a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a flagpole\nwhen I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with\nthis idea, and these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But\nsoon difficulties presented themselves. The pole was nearly\nhorizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the next place,\nthere was no pulley, ring, or cord by which to attach a flag; finally,\nthere were elsewhere on the boat two vertical staffs from which flags\nwere occasionally flown. It seemed probable that the pole was not\nthere for flag-flying.\n\u201cI then tried to imagine all possible purposes of the pole, and\nto consider for which of these it was best suited: (a) Possibly it was\nan ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even the tugboats carried\npoles, this hypothesis was rejected. (b) Possibly it was the terminal\nof a wireless telegraph. But the same considerations made this\nimprobable. Besides, the more natural place for such a terminal would\nbe the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house. (c) Its\npurpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat is\nmoving.\n\u201cIn support of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was\nlower than the pilot house, so that the steersman could easily see it.\nMoreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so that, from the\npilot\u2019s position, it must appear to project far out in front of\nthe boat. Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he\nwould need some such guide as to its direction. Tugboats would also\nneed poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis was so much more\nprobable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion\nthat the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the\ndirection in which the boat pointed, to enable him to steer\ncorrectly.\u201d (Dewey 1910: 69\u201370; 1933: 92\u201393)\nBubbles\n: \u201cIn washing tumblers in hot soapsuds and\nplacing them mouth downward on a plate, bubbles appeared on the\noutside of the mouth of the tumblers and then went inside. Why? The\npresence of bubbles suggests air, which I note must come from inside\nthe tumbler. I see that the soapy water on the plate prevents escape\nof the air save as it may be caught in bubbles. But why should air\nleave the tumbler? There was no substance entering to force it out. It\nmust have expanded. It expands by increase of heat, or by decrease of\npressure, or both. Could the air have become heated after the tumbler\nwas taken from the hot suds? Clearly not the air that was already\nentangled in the water. If heated air was the cause, cold air must\nhave entered in transferring the tumblers from the suds to the plate.\nI test to see if this supposition is true by taking several more\ntumblers out. Some I shake so as to make sure of entrapping cold air\nin them. Some I take out holding mouth downward in order to prevent\ncold air from entering. Bubbles appear on the outside of every one of\nthe former and on none of the latter. I must be right in my inference.\nAir from the outside must have been expanded by the heat of the\ntumbler, which explains the appearance of the bubbles on the outside.\nBut why do they then go inside? Cold contracts. The tumbler cooled and\nalso the air inside it. Tension was removed, and hence bubbles\nappeared inside. To be sure of this, I test by placing a cup of ice on\nthe tumbler while the bubbles are still forming outside. They soon\nreverse\u201d (Dewey 1910: 70\u201371; 1933: 93\u201394).\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\nWeather\n: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\nDisorder\n: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\nTyphoid\n: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\nBlur\n: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\nSuction pump\n: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n2.3 Further Examples\nDiamond\n: A passenger in a car driving in a diamond lane\nreserved for vehicles with at least one passenger notices that the\ndiamond marks on the pavement are far apart in some places and close\ntogether in others. Why? The driver suggests that the reason may be\nthat the diamond marks are not needed where there is a solid double\nline separating the diamond lane from the adjoining lane, but are\nneeded when there is a dotted single line permitting crossing into the\ndiamond lane. Further observation confirms that the diamonds are close\ntogether when a dotted line separates the diamond lane from its\nneighbour, but otherwise far apart.\nRash\n: A woman suddenly develops a very itchy red rash on her\nthroat and upper chest. She recently noticed a mark on the back of her\nright hand, but was not sure whether the mark was a rash or a scrape.\nShe lies down in bed and thinks about what might be causing the rash\nand what to do about it. About two weeks before, she began taking\nblood pressure medication that contained a sulfa drug, and the\npharmacist had warned her, in view of a previous allergic reaction to\na medication containing a sulfa drug, to be on the alert for an\nallergic reaction; however, she had been taking the medication for two\nweeks with no such effect. The day before, she began using a new cream\non her neck and upper chest; against the new cream as the cause was\nmark on the back of her hand, which had not been exposed to the cream.\nShe began taking probiotics about a month before. She also recently\nstarted new eye drops, but she supposed that manufacturers of eye\ndrops would be careful not to include allergy-causing components in\nthe medication. The rash might be a heat rash, since she recently was\nsweating profusely from her upper body. Since she is about to go away\non a short vacation, where she would not have access to her usual\nphysician, she decides to keep taking the probiotics and using the new\neye drops but to discontinue the blood pressure medication and to\nswitch back to the old cream for her neck and upper chest. She forms a\nplan to consult her regular physician on her return about the blood\npressure medication.\nCandidate\n: Although Dewey included no examples of thinking\ndirected at appraising the arguments of others, such thinking has come\nto be considered a kind of critical thinking. We find an example of\nsuch thinking in the performance task on the Collegiate Learning\nAssessment (CLA+), which its sponsoring organization describes as\na performance-based assessment that provides a measure of an\ninstitution\u2019s contribution to the development of\ncritical-thinking and written communication skills of its students.\n(Council for Aid to Education 2017)\nA sample task posted on its website requires the test-taker to write a\nreport for public distribution evaluating a fictional\ncandidate\u2019s policy proposals and their supporting arguments,\nusing supplied background documents, with a recommendation on whether\nto endorse the candidate.\n2.4 Non-examples\nImmediate acceptance of an idea that suggests itself as a solution to\na problem (e.g., a possible explanation of an event or phenomenon, an\naction that seems likely to produce a desired result) is\n\u201cuncritical thinking, the minimum of reflection\u201d (Dewey\n1910: 13). On-going suspension of judgment in the light of doubt about\na possible solution is not critical thinking (Dewey 1910: 108).\nCritique driven by a dogmatically held political or religious ideology\nis not critical thinking; thus Paulo Freire (1968 [1970]) is using the\nterm (e.g., at 1970: 71, 81, 100, 146) in a more politically freighted\nsense that includes not only reflection but also revolutionary action\nagainst oppression. Derivation of a conclusion from given data using\nan algorithm is not critical thinking.\n3. The Definition of Critical Thinking\nWhat is critical thinking? There are many definitions. Ennis (2016)\nlists 14 philosophically oriented scholarly definitions and three\ndictionary definitions. Following Rawls (1971), who distinguished his\nconception of justice from a utilitarian conception but regarded them\nas rival conceptions of the same concept, Ennis maintains that the 17\ndefinitions are different conceptions of the same concept. Rawls\narticulated the shared concept of justice as\na characteristic set of principles for assigning basic rights and\nduties and for determining\u2026 the proper distribution of the\nbenefits and burdens of social cooperation. (Rawls 1971: 5)\nBailin et al. (1999b) claim that, if one considers what sorts of\nthinking an educator would take not to be critical thinking and what\nsorts to be critical thinking, one can conclude that educators\ntypically understand critical thinking to have at least three\nfeatures.\nIt is done for the purpose of making up one\u2019s mind about\nwhat to believe or do.\nThe person engaging in the thinking is trying to fulfill standards\nof adequacy and accuracy appropriate to the thinking.\nThe thinking fulfills the relevant standards to some threshold\nlevel.\nOne could sum up the core concept that involves these three features\nby saying that critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking.\nThis core concept seems to apply to all the examples of critical\nthinking described in the previous section. As for the non-examples,\ntheir exclusion depends on construing careful thinking as excluding\njumping immediately to conclusions, suspending judgment no matter how\nstrong the evidence, reasoning from an unquestioned ideological or\nreligious perspective, and routinely using an algorithm to answer a\nquestion.\nIf the core of critical thinking is careful goal-directed thinking,\nconceptions of it can vary according to its presumed scope, its\npresumed goal, one\u2019s criteria and threshold for being careful,\nand the thinking component on which one focuses. As to its scope, some\nconceptions (e.g., Dewey 1910, 1933) restrict it to constructive\nthinking on the basis of one\u2019s own observations and experiments,\nothers (e.g., Ennis 1962; Fisher & Scriven 1997; Johnson 1992) to\nappraisal of the products of such thinking. Ennis (1991) and Bailin et\nal. (1999b) take it to cover both construction and appraisal. As to\nits goal, some conceptions restrict it to forming a judgment (Dewey\n1910, 1933; Lipman 1987; Facione 1990a). Others allow for actions as\nwell as beliefs as the end point of a process of critical thinking\n(Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b). As to the criteria and threshold\nfor being careful, definitions vary in the term used to indicate that\ncritical thinking satisfies certain norms: \u201cintellectually\ndisciplined\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987), \u201creasonable\u201d\n(Ennis 1991), \u201cskillful\u201d (Lipman 1987),\n\u201cskilled\u201d (Fisher & Scriven 1997),\n\u201ccareful\u201d (Bailin & Battersby 2009). Some definitions\nspecify these norms, referring variously to \u201cconsideration of\nany belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the grounds\nthat support it and the further conclusions to which it tends\u201d\n(Dewey 1910, 1933); \u201cthe methods of logical inquiry and\nreasoning\u201d (Glaser 1941); \u201cconceptualizing, applying,\nanalyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,\nor generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or\ncommunication\u201d (Scriven & Paul 1987); the requirement that\n\u201cit is sensitive to context, relies on criteria, and is\nself-correcting\u201d (Lipman 1987); \u201cevidential, conceptual,\nmethodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations\u201d\n(Facione 1990a); and \u201cplus-minus considerations of the product\nin terms of appropriate standards (or criteria)\u201d (Johnson 1992).\nStanovich and Stanovich (2010) propose to ground the concept of\ncritical thinking in the concept of rationality, which they understand\nas combining epistemic rationality (fitting one\u2019s beliefs to the\nworld) and instrumental rationality (optimizing goal fulfillment); a\ncritical thinker, in their view, is someone with \u201ca propensity\nto override suboptimal responses from the autonomous mind\u201d\n(2010: 227). These variant specifications of norms for critical\nthinking are not necessarily incompatible with one another, and in any\ncase presuppose the core notion of thinking carefully. As to the\nthinking component singled out, some definitions focus on suspension\nof judgment during the thinking (Dewey 1910; McPeck 1981), others on\ninquiry while judgment is suspended (Bailin & Battersby 2009,\n2021), others on the resulting judgment (Facione 1990a), and still\nothers on responsiveness to reasons (Siegel 1988). Kuhn (2019) takes\ncritical thinking to be more a dialogic practice of advancing and\nresponding to arguments than an individual ability.\nIn educational contexts, a definition of critical thinking is a\n\u201cprogrammatic definition\u201d (Scheffler 1960: 19). It\nexpresses a practical program for achieving an educational goal. For\nthis purpose, a one-sentence formulaic definition is much less useful\nthan articulation of a critical thinking process, with criteria and\nstandards for the kinds of thinking that the process may involve. The\nreal educational goal is recognition, adoption and implementation by\nstudents of those criteria and standards. That adoption and\nimplementation in turn consists in acquiring the knowledge, abilities\nand dispositions of a critical thinker.\nConceptions of critical thinking generally do not include moral\nintegrity as part of the concept. Dewey, for example, took critical\nthinking to be the ultimate intellectual goal of education, but\ndistinguished it from the development of social cooperation among\nschool children, which he took to be the central moral goal. Ennis\n(1996, 2011) added to his previous list of critical thinking\ndispositions a group of dispositions to care about the dignity and\nworth of every person, which he described as a\n\u201ccorrelative\u201d (1996) disposition without which critical\nthinking would be less valuable and perhaps harmful. An educational\nprogram that aimed at developing critical thinking but not the\ncorrelative disposition to care about the dignity and worth of every\nperson, he asserted, \u201cwould be deficient and perhaps\ndangerous\u201d (Ennis 1996: 172).\n4. Its Value\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n5. The Process of Thinking Critically\nDespite the diversity of our 11 examples, one can recognize a common\npattern. Dewey analyzed it as consisting of five phases:\nsuggestions\n, in which the mind leaps forward to a\npossible solution;\nan intellectualization of the difficulty or perplexity into a\nproblem\nto be solved, a question for which the answer must be\nsought;\nthe use of one suggestion after another as a leading idea, or\nhypothesis\n, to initiate and guide observation and other\noperations in collection of factual material;\nthe mental elaboration of the idea or supposition as an idea or\nsupposition (\nreasoning\n, in the sense on which reasoning is a\npart, not the whole, of inference); and\ntesting the hypothesis by overt or imaginative action. (Dewey\n1933: 106\u2013107; italics in original)\nThe process of reflective thinking consisting of these phases would be\npreceded by a perplexed, troubled or confused situation and followed\nby a cleared-up, unified, resolved situation (Dewey 1933: 106). The\nterm \u2018phases\u2019 replaced the term \u2018steps\u2019 (Dewey\n1910: 72), thus removing the earlier suggestion of an invariant\nsequence. Variants of the above analysis appeared in (Dewey 1916: 177)\nand (Dewey 1938: 101\u2013119).\nThe variant formulations indicate the difficulty of giving a single\nlogical analysis of such a varied process. The process of critical\nthinking may have a spiral pattern, with the problem being redefined\nin the light of obstacles to solving it as originally formulated. For\nexample, the person in\nTransit\nmight have concluded that getting to the appointment at the scheduled\ntime was impossible and have reformulated the problem as that of\nrescheduling the appointment for a mutually convenient time. Further,\ndefining a problem does not always follow after or lead immediately to\nan idea of a suggested solution. Nor should it do so, as Dewey himself\nrecognized in describing the physician in\nTyphoid\nas avoiding any strong preference for this or that conclusion before\ngetting further information (Dewey 1910: 85; 1933: 170). People with a\nhypothesis in mind, even one to which they have a very weak\ncommitment, have a so-called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d\n(Nickerson 1998): they are likely to pay attention to evidence that\nconfirms the hypothesis and to ignore evidence that counts against it\nor for some competing hypothesis. Detectives, intelligence agencies,\nand investigators of airplane accidents are well advised to gather\nrelevant evidence systematically and to postpone even tentative\nadoption of an explanatory hypothesis until the collected evidence\nrules out with the appropriate degree of certainty all but one\nexplanation. Dewey\u2019s analysis of the critical thinking process\ncan be faulted as well for requiring acceptance or rejection of a\npossible solution to a defined problem, with no allowance for deciding\nin the light of the available evidence to suspend judgment. Further,\ngiven the great variety of kinds of problems for which reflection is\nappropriate, there is likely to be variation in its component events.\nPerhaps the best way to conceptualize the critical thinking process is\nas a checklist whose component events can occur in a variety of\norders, selectively, and more than once. These component events might\ninclude (1) noticing a difficulty, (2) defining the problem, (3)\ndividing the problem into manageable sub-problems, (4) formulating a\nvariety of possible solutions to the problem or sub-problem, (5)\ndetermining what evidence is relevant to deciding among possible\nsolutions to the problem or sub-problem, (6) devising a plan of\nsystematic observation or experiment that will uncover the relevant\nevidence, (7) carrying out the plan of systematic observation or\nexperimentation, (8) noting the results of the systematic observation\nor experiment, (9) gathering relevant testimony and information from\nothers, (10) judging the credibility of testimony and information\ngathered from others, (11) drawing conclusions from gathered evidence\nand accepted testimony, and (12) accepting a solution that the\nevidence adequately supports (cf. Hitchcock 2017: 485).\nChecklist conceptions of the process of critical thinking are open to\nthe objection that they are too mechanical and procedural to fit the\nmulti-dimensional and emotionally charged issues for which critical\nthinking is urgently needed (Paul 1984). For such issues, a more\ndialectical process is advocated, in which competing relevant world\nviews are identified, their implications explored, and some sort of\ncreative synthesis attempted.\n6. Components of the Process\nIf one considers the critical thinking process illustrated by the 11\nexamples, one can identify distinct kinds of mental acts and mental\nstates that form part of it. To distinguish, label and briefly\ncharacterize these components is a useful preliminary to identifying\nabilities, skills, dispositions, attitudes, habits and the like that\ncontribute causally to thinking critically. Identifying such abilities\nand habits is in turn a useful preliminary to setting educational\ngoals. Setting the goals is in its turn a useful preliminary to\ndesigning strategies for helping learners to achieve the goals and to\ndesigning ways of measuring the extent to which learners have done so.\nSuch measures provide both feedback to learners on their achievement\nand a basis for experimental research on the effectiveness of various\nstrategies for educating people to think critically. Let us begin,\nthen, by distinguishing the kinds of mental acts and mental events\nthat can occur in a critical thinking process.\nObserving\n: One notices something in one\u2019s immediate\nenvironment (sudden cooling of temperature in\nWeather\n,\nbubbles forming outside a glass and then going inside in\nBubbles\n,\na moving blur in the distance in\nBlur\n,\na rash in\nRash\n).\nOr one notes the results of an experiment or systematic observation\n(valuables missing in\nDisorder\n,\nno suction without air pressure in\nSuction pump\n)\nFeeling\n: One feels puzzled or uncertain about something\n(how to get to an appointment on time in\nTransit\n,\nwhy the diamonds vary in spacing in\nDiamond\n).\nOne wants to resolve this perplexity. One feels satisfaction once one\nhas worked out an answer (to take the subway express in\nTransit\n, diamonds closer when needed as a warning in\nDiamond\n).\nWondering\n: One formulates a question to be addressed (why\nbubbles form outside a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nhow suction pumps work in\nSuction pump\n,\nwhat caused the rash in\nRash\n).\nImagining\n: One thinks of possible answers (bus or subway\nor elevated in\nTransit\n,\nflagpole or ornament or wireless communication aid or direction\nindicator in\nFerryboat\n,\nallergic reaction or heat rash in\nRash\n).\nInferring\n: One works out what would be the case if a\npossible answer were assumed (valuables missing if there has been a\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\nearlier start to the rash if it is an allergic reaction to a sulfa\ndrug in\nRash\n).\nOr one draws a conclusion once sufficient relevant evidence is\ngathered (take the subway in\nTransit\n,\nburglary in\nDisorder\n,\ndiscontinue blood pressure medication and new cream in\nRash\n).\nKnowledge\n: One uses stored knowledge of the\nsubject-matter to generate possible answers or to infer what would be\nexpected on the assumption of a particular answer (knowledge of a\ncity\u2019s public transit system in\nTransit\n,\nof the requirements for a flagpole in\nFerryboat\n,\nof Boyle\u2019s law in\nBubbles\n,\nof allergic reactions in\nRash\n).\nExperimenting\n: One designs and carries out an experiment\nor a systematic observation to find out whether the results deduced\nfrom a possible answer will occur (looking at the location of the\nflagpole in relation to the pilot\u2019s position in\nFerryboat\n,\nputting an ice cube on top of a tumbler taken from hot water in\nBubbles\n,\nmeasuring the height to which a suction pump will draw water at\ndifferent elevations in\nSuction pump\n,\nnoticing the spacing of diamonds when movement to or from a diamond\nlane is allowed in\nDiamond\n).\nConsulting\n: One finds a source of information, gets the\ninformation from the source, and makes a judgment on whether to accept\nit. None of our 11 examples include searching for sources of\ninformation. In this respect they are unrepresentative, since most\npeople nowadays have almost instant access to information relevant to\nanswering any question, including many of those illustrated by the\nexamples. However,\nCandidate\nincludes the activities of extracting information from sources and\nevaluating its credibility.\nIdentifying and analyzing arguments\n: One notices an\nargument and works out its structure and content as a preliminary to\nevaluating its strength. This activity is central to\nCandidate\n.\nIt is an important part of a critical thinking process in which one\nsurveys arguments for various positions on an issue.\nJudging\n: One makes a judgment on the basis of accumulated\nevidence and reasoning, such as the judgment in\nFerryboat\nthat the purpose of the pole is to provide direction to the\npilot.\nDeciding\n: One makes a decision on what to do or on what\npolicy to adopt, as in the decision in\nTransit\nto take the subway.\n7. Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n8. Critical Thinking Dispositions\nEducational researchers use the term \u2018dispositions\u2019\nbroadly for the habits of mind and attitudes that contribute causally\nto being a critical thinker. Some writers (e.g., Paul & Elder\n2006; Hamby 2014; Bailin & Battersby 2016a) propose to use the\nterm \u2018virtues\u2019 for this dimension of a critical thinker.\nThe virtues in question, although they are virtues of character,\nconcern the person\u2019s ways of thinking rather than the\nperson\u2019s ways of behaving towards others. They are not moral\nvirtues but intellectual virtues, of the sort articulated by Zagzebski\n(1996) and discussed by Turri, Alfano, and Greco (2017).\nOn a realistic conception, thinking dispositions or intellectual\nvirtues are real properties of thinkers. They are general tendencies,\npropensities, or inclinations to think in particular ways in\nparticular circumstances, and can be genuinely explanatory (Siegel\n1999). Sceptics argue that there is no evidence for a specific mental\nbasis for the habits of mind that contribute to thinking critically,\nand that it is pedagogically misleading to posit such a basis (Bailin\net al. 1999a). Whatever their status, critical thinking dispositions\nneed motivation for their initial formation in a\nchild\u2014motivation that may be external or internal. As children\ndevelop, the force of habit will gradually become important in\nsustaining the disposition (Nieto & Valenzuela 2012). Mere force\nof habit, however, is unlikely to sustain critical thinking\ndispositions. Critical thinkers must value and enjoy using their\nknowledge and abilities to think things through for themselves. They\nmust be committed to, and lovers of, inquiry.\nA person may have a critical thinking disposition with respect to only\nsome kinds of issues. For example, one could be open-minded about\nscientific issues but not about religious issues. Similarly, one could\nbe confident in one\u2019s ability to reason about the theological\nimplications of the existence of evil in the world but not in\none\u2019s ability to reason about the best design for a guided\nballistic missile.\nFacione (1990a: 25) divides \u201caffective dispositions\u201d of\ncritical thinking into approaches to life and living in general and\napproaches to specific issues, questions or problems. Adapting this\ndistinction, one can usefully divide critical thinking dispositions\ninto initiating dispositions (those that contribute causally to\nstarting to think critically about an issue) and internal dispositions\n(those that contribute causally to doing a good job of thinking\ncritically once one has started). The two categories are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, open-mindedness, in the sense of willingness\nto consider alternative points of view to one\u2019s own, is both an\ninitiating and an internal disposition.\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\nAttentiveness\n: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\nWeather\nwould not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry\n: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\nBubbles\ncould easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence\n: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\nRash\nlacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage\n: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness\n: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment\n: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason\n: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth\n: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n8.2 Internal Dispositions\nSome of the initiating dispositions, such as open-mindedness and\nwillingness to suspend judgment, are also internal critical thinking\ndispositions, in the sense of mental habits or attitudes that\ncontribute causally to doing a good job of critical thinking once one\nstarts the process. But there are many other internal critical\nthinking dispositions. Some of them are parasitic on one\u2019s\nconception of good thinking. For example, it is constitutive of good\nthinking about an issue to formulate the issue clearly and to maintain\nfocus on it. For this purpose, one needs not only the corresponding\nability but also the corresponding disposition. Ennis (1991: 8)\ndescribes it as the disposition \u201cto determine and maintain focus\non the conclusion or question\u201d, Facione (1990a: 25) as\n\u201cclarity in stating the question or concern\u201d. Other\ninternal dispositions are motivators to continue or adjust the\ncritical thinking process, such as willingness to persist in a complex\ntask and willingness to abandon nonproductive strategies in an attempt\nto self-correct (Halpern 1998: 452). For a list of identified internal\ncritical thinking dispositions, see the\nSupplement on Internal Critical Thinking Dispositions\n.\n9. Critical Thinking Abilities\nSome theorists postulate skills, i.e., acquired abilities, as\noperative in critical thinking. It is not obvious, however, that a\ngood mental act is the exercise of a generic acquired skill. Inferring\nan expected time of arrival, as in\nTransit\n,\nhas some generic components but also uses non-generic subject-matter\nknowledge. Bailin et al. (1999a) argue against viewing critical\nthinking skills as generic and discrete, on the ground that skilled\nperformance at a critical thinking task cannot be separated from\nknowledge of concepts and from domain-specific principles of good\nthinking. Talk of skills, they concede, is unproblematic if it means\nmerely that a person with critical thinking skills is capable of\nintelligent performance.\nDespite such scepticism, theorists of critical thinking have listed as\ngeneral contributors to critical thinking what they variously call\nabilities (Glaser 1941; Ennis 1962, 1991), skills (Facione 1990a;\nHalpern 1998) or competencies (Fisher & Scriven 1997).\nAmalgamating these lists would produce a confusing and chaotic\ncornucopia of more than 50 possible educational objectives, with only\npartial overlap among them. It makes sense instead to try to\nunderstand the reasons for the multiplicity and diversity, and to make\na selection according to one\u2019s own reasons for singling out\nabilities to be developed in a critical thinking curriculum. Two\nreasons for diversity among lists of critical thinking abilities are\nthe underlying conception of critical thinking and the envisaged\neducational level. Appraisal-only conceptions, for example, involve a\ndifferent suite of abilities than constructive-only conceptions. Some\nlists, such as those in (Glaser 1941), are put forward as educational\nobjectives for secondary school students, whereas others are proposed\nas objectives for college students (e.g., Facione 1990a).\nThe abilities described in the remaining paragraphs of this section\nemerge from reflection on the general abilities needed to do well the\nthinking activities identified in\nsection 6\nas components of the critical thinking process described in\nsection 5\n.\nThe derivation of each collection of abilities is accompanied by\ncitation of sources that list such abilities and of standardized tests\nthat claim to test them.\nObservational abilities\n: Careful and accurate observation\nsometimes requires specialist expertise and practice, as in the case\nof observing birds and observing accident scenes. However, there are\ngeneral abilities of noticing what one\u2019s senses are picking up\nfrom one\u2019s environment and of being able to articulate clearly\nand accurately to oneself and others what one has observed. It helps\nin exercising them to be able to recognize and take into account\nfactors that make one\u2019s observation less trustworthy, such as\nprior framing of the situation, inadequate time, deficient senses,\npoor observation conditions, and the like. It helps as well to be\nskilled at taking steps to make one\u2019s observation more\ntrustworthy, such as moving closer to get a better look, measuring\nsomething three times and taking the average, and checking what one\nthinks one is observing with someone else who is in a good position to\nobserve it. It also helps to be skilled at recognizing respects in\nwhich one\u2019s report of one\u2019s observation involves inference\nrather than direct observation, so that one can then consider whether\nthe inference is justified. These abilities come into play as well\nwhen one thinks about whether and with what degree of confidence to\naccept an observation report, for example in the study of history or\nin a criminal investigation or in assessing news reports.\nObservational abilities show up in some lists of critical thinking\nabilities (Ennis 1962: 90; Facione 1990a: 16; Ennis 1991: 9). There\nare items testing a person\u2019s ability to judge the credibility of\nobservation reports in the Cornell Critical Thinking Tests, Levels X\nand Z (Ennis & Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, & Tomko 1985,\n2005). Norris and King (1983, 1985, 1990a, 1990b) is a test of ability\nto appraise observation reports.\nEmotional abilities\n: The emotions that drive a critical\nthinking process are perplexity or puzzlement, a wish to resolve it,\nand satisfaction at a\n\n\n\n---\n\nThe council should use all of this context when addressing the prompt above.

How should concepts like informed consent and respect for patient autonomy shape your answer?\n\n2. AI systems trained on historical clinical data can reproduce and even amplify existing social and medical biases (e.g., along lines of race, gender, age, disability).

Consider responsibility and accountability: when an AI system involved in diagnosis, treatment planning, or robot-assisted care contributes to serious patient harm, how should moral and legal responsibility be distributed among the clinician, the hospital, the AI developers, and the institution that chose to deploy the system?

            "response": "Based on the provided screenplay documents detailing the design of a social care robot and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on critical thinking, here are 5 critical thinking questions suitable for a university-level ethics class.\n\nThese questions address specific functionalities mentioned in the technical context (Validation Therapy, proactive engagement, vision systems) and apply ethical frameworks regarding agency, privacy, and the nature of care.\n\n### 1. The Ethics of \"Simulated\" Empathy and Deception\n**Context:** The screenplay emphasizes that the robot must demonstrate \"active listening\" and \"empathic responses\" (e.g., facial expressions that show care, mirroring joy or sadness). The goal is to build a \"trusting companion relationship.\"\n**Question:** If a social robot is programmed to simulate emotions it cannot feel\u2014specifically to facilitate **Validation Therapy** for seniors with cognitive decline\u2014are the designers engaging in an unethical form of deception? Does the therapeutic outcome (the patient feeling understood) outweigh the moral cost of fabricating an emotional bond, or does this violate the user\u2019s dignity by substituting authentic human connection with algorithmic mimicry?\n\n### 2. Algorithmic Paternalism vs. Autonomy\n**Context:** The document describes a \"Proactive Engagement\" use case where the robot uses \"situational awareness\" to observe a user who is silent or slumped. The robot then decides to initiate conversation or suggest \"Mini CBT\" (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) exercises, such as breathing techniques, to alter the user's state.\n**Question:** When an AI system moves from passive obedience to proactive intervention based on its own assessment of a human\u2019s \"body language\" and \"mood,\" where is the ethical line between helpful assistance and algorithmic paternalism? By allowing a robot to decide when a human \"can benefit from some cognitive social engagement,\" are we stripping vulnerable adults of their autonomy to simply be alone or experience negative emotions without interference?\n\n### 3. The Panopticon of Care: Privacy vs. \"Situational Awareness\"\n**Context:** To function as described, the robot requires constant input from Nvidia hardware and Vision APIs to detect open mouths, lean-in postures, and facial expressions\u2014even when the user is not actively speaking (described in the \"Turn-Taking Awareness\" and \"Interrupt Permission Cue\" interactions).\n**Question:** The robot constructs a \"trusting relationship\" through continuous surveillance of the user's physical and emotional states. In an ethical framework, can true \"privacy\" exist if an AI companion must constantly monitor a patient's non-verbal cues to function safely? How should we weigh the clinical benefits of \"context-specific memory recall\" against the risks of creating a database of an elderly person\u2019s most vulnerable moments?\n\n### 4. Epistemic Rationality and Validation Therapy\n**Context:** The **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** links critical thinking to \"epistemic rationality\" (fitting beliefs to the world). However, the robot is designed to use **Validation Therapy**, effectively agreeing with a user\u2019s \"misbelief\" (e.g., waiting for a deceased parent) to reduce anxiety, rather than correcting them (\"Emotion first, facts later\").\n**Question:** From a virtue ethics perspective, does the use of AI to reinforce delusions\u2014even for benevolent therapeutic reasons\u2014harm the user's rationality? By designing a machine that prioritizes emotional pacification over objective truth, are we failing a moral obligation to treat older adults as rational agents, effectively infantilizing them?\n\n### 5. Interactional Obsolescence and the \"Perfect\" Conversationalist\n**Context:** The screenplay creates strict rules for the robot to ensure it is \"graceful,\" \"elegant,\" and \"friendly.\" It never interrupts, it signals how long it needs to think, and it yields the floor immediately if the user gestures. It is designed to remove the friction and frustration inherent in human conversation.\n**Question:** If AI caretakers are designed to be \"perfect\" conversationalists that never interrupt, always remember details, and endlessly validate the user, what are the long-term ethical implications for human-to-human relationships? By commodifying social interaction into a friction-free utility, do we risk making messy, imperfect human empathy seem undesirable or obsolete to those experiencing social isolation?"

            "response": "# Critical Thinking Questions on AI Ethics in Healthcare\n\nBased on the uploaded screenplay document and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's framework on critical thinking, here are five critical thinking questions suitable for a university-level ethics class:\n\n## 1. **Autonomy vs. Beneficence: When should a social care robot override an older adult's preferences?**\n\nThe screenplay describes a robot designed to provide \"proactive engagement\" and initiate conversations when it detects that \"human can benefit for some cognitive social engagement.\" This raises a fundamental tension: \n\n- If the robot is programmed to intervene when it detects cognitive decline or emotional distress, at what point does beneficial assistance become paternalistic override of patient autonomy?\n- How do we distinguish between supportive prompting (e.g., \"Would you like to chat?\") and manipulative nudging when the AI is specifically designed to influence behavior using therapeutic techniques like CBT and Validation Therapy?\n- Should there be situations where the robot *withholds* intervention even when its algorithms detect potential benefit, purely to respect autonomy?\n\n**Extension**: Consider how this differs from human caregivers, who can exercise contextual judgment and emotional reciprocity that current AI cannot replicate.\n\n## 2. **Authenticity and Deception: Is therapeutic benefit achieved through simulated empathy ethically problematic?**\n\nThe screenplay emphasizes the robot showing \"care and empathy\" through \"empathic responses\" and building a \"trusting companion relationship.\" Yet the document also reveals this is achieved through programmed facial expressions, calculated timing, and strategic memory recall designed to create the *appearance* of caring:\n\n- If older adults form genuine emotional attachments to robots that are incapable of reciprocal caring, does this constitute a form of therapeutic deception, even if beneficial?\n- Does the distinction between \"appearing to care\" and \"actually caring\" matter ethically if patient outcomes improve?\n- How does this relate to the concept of \"informed consent\"\u2014should patients be explicitly told their companion \"doesn't actually care\" about them, or would this undermine therapeutic effectiveness?\n\n**Framework**: Apply Kant's categorical imperative vs. utilitarian calculus to this dilemma.\n\n## 3. **Data Privacy and Surveillance: What are the ethical boundaries of continuous monitoring for therapeutic purposes?**\n\nThe robot is designed with \"vision, speech and language capabilities\" that enable it to observe body language, detect emotional states, remember \"important daily life and family related events,\" and make \"situational awareness\" decisions. This requires:\n\n- Continuous audiovisual monitoring of intimate spaces (homes, care facilities)\n- Storage and analysis of highly personal conversations and emotional states\n- Pattern recognition that could reveal cognitive decline before the patient is aware\n\n**Questions to explore**:\n- Who owns this data? Who can access it?

This implies significant cost and technical complexity:\n\n- If effective social care robots become available only to wealthy individuals or well-funded facilities, does this create a two-tier system where the privileged receive advanced AI companionship while others remain isolated?\n- Conversely, if AI companions become a cost-cutting measure that replaces human caregivers for lower-income populations, does this create a scenario where the poor get robots while the rich get humans?\n- How do cultural differences in attitudes toward technology, aging, and care affect equitable deployment? (The robot's design appears culturally specific\u2014would different populations require fundamentally different approaches?)\n\n**Consider**: The document mentions validation with \"experts\" and \"actual older adults\"\u2014but which populations are represented in this validation?\n\n## 5. **Responsibility and Accountability: Who is liable when an AI therapeutic intervention causes harm?**\n\nThe screenplay describes the robot using evidence-based therapeutic approaches (Reminiscence Therapy, Validation Therapy, CBT) and making autonomous decisions about when to engage, what to say, and how to respond to emotional cues:\n\n- If the robot's CBT intervention exacerbates a patient's anxiety rather than reducing it, who bears responsibility\u2014the designers, the healthcare facility, the AI company, or the algorithms themselves?\n- If the robot fails to detect a medical emergency (e.g., stroke symptoms) because it interprets the signs as mere \"thinking pose,\" what level of care should we expect it to provide?\n- The document states \"we don't [care about] the hardware or AI limitations but rather creative imagination limitations\"\u2014but shouldn't ethical deployment be *constrained* by current limitations rather than aspirational capabilities?\n\n**Key tension**: The more autonomous and \"intelligent\" we make these systems, the more they resemble independent agents\u2014yet legal and ethical frameworks struggle with non-human accountability.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion Framework\n\nThese questions are designed to encourage students to:\n- Apply multiple ethical frameworks (deontological, consequentialist, virtue ethics, care ethics)\n- Consider stakeholder perspectives (patients, families, caregivers, healthcare systems, society)\n- Distinguish between technical capabilities and ethical permissibility\n- Recognize tensions between competing values (autonomy/beneficence, privacy/safety, innovation/equity)\n- Think critically about how emerging technologies challenge existing ethical categories\n\nEach question resists simple answers and requires careful consideration of context, consequences, and competing moral obligations\u2014the hallmarks of critical thinking as defined by the Stanford Encyclopedia source."

            "response": "### Council Deliberation Report\n\n**Council Members Participating:**  \n- **ChatGPT Representative:** Focuses on structured, predictable interaction languages for social assistive robots (SARs), emphasizing transparency, empathy, and therapy-aligned behaviors to build trust with older adults.  \n- **Perplexity Representative:** Emphasizes empathetic, non-intrusive HRI designs, drawing from best practices in vision-detected cues, therapy integration, and short, respectful responses to reduce frustration and isolation.  \n- **Gemini Representative:** Highlights micro-movements, visual feedback, and state transparency in robot behaviors, aligned with HRI research on respecting user autonomy and emotional resonance.  \n- **Critical Thinking Expert (from Stanford Encyclopedia Link):** Guides the formulation of questions to embody reflective thinking processes (e.g., problem intellectualization, hypothesis testing, evidence evaluation), as per Dewey's phases and Ennis's dispositions (e.g., open-mindedness, trust in reason).  \n\n**Deliberation Summary:**  \nThe council reviewed the provided context, including the user's original prompt for creating screenplays and animated videos of a social care robot for older adults experiencing mild cognitive decline, loneliness, or anxiety. This robot, built on ROS, Nvidia hardware, and Microsoft AI, integrates therapies like Reminiscence Therapy, Validation Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to foster trusting, empathetic interactions. Responses from ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini collectively emphasize ethical design elements such as predictability (e.g., thinking timers to avoid frustration), autonomy-respecting behaviors (e.g., non-interruption based on body language detection), empathy (e.g., emotional mirroring without overstepping), and transparency (e.g., clear state cues like facial expressions and micro-movements).  \n\nWe drew from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Critical Thinking, which defines it as \"careful goal-directed thinking\" involving phases like suggestion, problem formulation, hypothesis testing, and evidence-based judgment. This informs our questions, ensuring they prompt university-level students to engage in reflective, evidence-based analysis rather than rote responses. Ethical implications are framed around real-world HRI challenges in healthcare, such as data privacy (e.g., memory recall from past interactions), emotional dependency (e.g., robot as \"companion\"), equity (e.g., access for diverse elderly populations), and dehumanization risks (e.g., replacing human caregivers).  \n\nThe council unanimously agrees that AI in healthcare, as exemplified by this social care robot, raises profound ethical questions about human dignity, consent, and societal impact. We synthesized the context to create questions that encourage students to critically evaluate these implications, incorporating elements like the robot's multimodal capabilities (vision, speech, empathy) and validation goals (e.g., expert/user testing for usefulness). Questions are designed to be open-ended, promoting Deweyan reflective thinking: noticing perplexities, formulating problems, hypothesizing solutions, and testing via evidence or dialogue.\n\n**5 Critical Thinking Questions on Ethical Implications of AI in Healthcare:**  \nThese questions are suitable for a university-level ethics class, encouraging students to draw on philosophical concepts (e.g., autonomy, beneficence) while analyzing real-world AI applications like the social care robot described. Each question includes a brief rationale tying it to the context and critical thinking principles.\n\n1. **Autonomy and Dependency:** In the context of a social care robot that uses AI to recall personal memories and initiate conversations based on observed body language (as in the \"Memory Recall Spark\" or \"Proactive Engagement Check\" screenplays), how might this technology enhance or undermine an older adult's autonomy? Critically evaluate potential risks of emotional dependency, using evidence from HRI best practices (e.g., validation therapy) to propose ethical safeguards.  \n   *Rationale:* This prompts hypothesis testing (e.g., weighing benefits like reduced loneliness against risks like over-reliance) and open-minded inquiry, aligning with Dewey's phases and the context's emphasis on non-intrusive, autonomy-respecting interactions.\n\n2. **Privacy and Data Ethics:** Given that the robot processes vision, speech, and contextual data on the edge (e.g., for active listening and memory recall in scenarios like \"I Remember What Matters to You\"), what ethical dilemmas arise regarding data privacy for vulnerable users with mild cognitive decline? Formulate a problem statement on consent and analyze how transparency cues (e.g., thinking timers) could mitigate surveillance concerns, drawing on philosophical norms like trust in reason.  \n   *Rationale:* Encourages problem intellectualization and evidence evaluation, reflecting Ennis's disposition of seeking truth, while tying to the context's focus on predictable, frustration-free interactions validated by experts and caregivers.\n\n3. **Equity and Access:** The robot's design incorporates therapies like CBT and reminiscence to address isolation, but assumes access to advanced hardware (Nvidia/Microsoft AI). Critically assess how this might exacerbate healthcare inequities for underrepresented older adults (e.g., diverse ethnicities or socioeconomic groups, as suggested in Perplexity's diverse actor recommendations). Hypothesize alternative designs and test them against criteria for inclusive ethics.  \n   *Rationale:* Promotes willingness to suspend judgment and consider alternatives, per critical thinking dispositions, while addressing the context's validation goals with older adults and caregivers for relevance and usefulness.\n\n4. **Dehumanization vs. Empathy:** Screenplays emphasize empathetic responses (e.g., \"Emotion First, Facts Later\" in validation therapy or facial mirroring in \"Joy Mirroring Boost\"). To what extent does an AI robot's simulation of empathy (via screen expressions and tone matching) risk dehumanizing care, potentially replacing human interactions? Use reflective reasoning to argue for or against its ethical use in scenarios of social isolation, incorporating evidence from SAR research.  \n   *Rationale:* Invokes emotional and observational abilities in critical thinking, as per the Stanford entry, and draws from the context's core principles of short, respectful robot responses to prioritize human sharing.\n\n5. **Accountability and Bias:** If the robot misinterprets body language or incomplete sentences (e.g., in \"Incomplete Sentence Patience\" or \"Repair: I Didn\u2019t Catch That\"), leading to flawed therapy outcomes, who bears ethical responsibility\u2014the engineers, AI providers, or caregivers? Critically analyze potential biases in AI training data (e.g., for diverse elderly expressions) and propose a framework for accountability, testing it against real-world HRI validation processes.  \n   *Rationale:* Facilitates inference and judgment based on accumulated evidence, embodying Dewey's testing phase, while linking to the context's engineering specs (e.g., ROS nodes for multimodal sync) and goals for prototype validation.\n\n**Recommendations for Class Use:**  \n- Assign readings from the Stanford entry to ground discussions in critical thinking theory.  \n- Have students reference the provided screenplays (e.g., as case studies) to apply concepts concretely.  \n- Encourage group deliberations mimicking this council format to foster dialogic critical thinking (Kuhn, 2019).  \n\nThis response fully integrates the context, ensuring questions are ethically robust, critically oriented, and directly relevant to AI-driven healthcare innovations like the social care robot."

It barely engages with the specific therapies (Reminiscence, Validation, CBT), detailed HRI behaviors, or the nuanced turn-taking issues in the screenplay.\n  - Does not explicitly connect to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\u2019s framing of critical thinking (e.g., epistemic vs instrumental rationality, dispositions, Deweyan reflective thinking).\n  - Compared to other responses, it is somewhat generic: it could have been written for AI in healthcare without having seen the robot screenplay or SEP article at all.\n  - The questions, while strong, don\u2019t explicitly nudge students toward using multiple ethical frameworks or reflecting on the nature of critical thinking itself, which the context invites.\n\n\nResponse B:\n- Does well:\n  - Deeply integrates the social-care-robot context: every question is explicitly grounded in specific scenarios from the screenplay (simulated empathy, proactive engagement, body-language-based interventions, validation therapy, \u201cperfect\u201d conversationalist design).\n  - Strongly aligns with the SEP critical thinking article:\n    - Question 4 directly references \u201cepistemic rationality\u201d and contrasts it with Validation Therapy\u2019s emotion-first approach.\n    - Questions push students to grapple with truth vs therapeutic benefit, autonomy vs paternalism, privacy vs situational awareness\u2014classic critical-thinking tensions.\n  - Each question is genuinely complex and non-trivial, ideal for a university-level ethics class:\n    - Q1 on simulated empathy and deception in Validation Therapy is philosophically rich and tightly tied to the document.\n    - Q2 on algorithmic paternalism vs autonomy highlights proactive nudging based on body language\u2014very context-specific and subtle.\n    - Q3 (\u201cPanopticon of Care\u201d) frames continuous monitoring as a surveillance/benefit trade-off.\n    - Q4 explicitly invites virtue-ethics analysis and rational agency concerns.\n    - Q5 on \u201cperfect\u201d conversationalists raises long-term sociocultural impacts on human empathy.\n  - The questions themselves are cleanly stated after brief context, with no unnecessary meta-commentary; they\u2019re ready to drop straight into a syllabus.\n\n- Does poorly:\n  - Focuses almost entirely on the social robot case; it doesn\u2019t explicitly broaden to other forms of AI in healthcare (e.g., diagnostic systems, triage algorithms). However, the original context is robot-heavy, so this is a minor issue.\n  - Slightly verbose in the contextual lead-ins; some instructors might prefer tighter phrasing. But for a university ethics setting, this added context can actually be useful for framing seminar discussion.\n\n\nResponse C:\n- Does well:\n  - Provides 5 substantial, well-structured questions with sub-questions and suggested frameworks:\n    - Autonomy vs beneficence in proactive engagement.\n    - Authenticity and deception in simulated empathy.\n    - Data privacy and surveillance.\n    - Equity and access for advanced robotic care.\n    - Responsibility and accountability for harms.\n  - Strongly leverages the screenplay context: references proactive engagement, Validation and CBT, vision and memory recall, hardware stack, and validation with older adults.\n  - Explicitly encourages application of ethical theories (e.g., Kantian vs utilitarian in Q2), which is excellent for university-level work.\n  - Implicitly uses SEP themes: critical thinking as weighing evidence, engaging multiple perspectives, and balancing competing values.\n  - Each question is genuinely open-ended and invites careful argument rather than quick opinion.\n\n- Does poorly:\n  - Less explicit than Response B in drawing on the SEP critical-thinking vocabulary (epistemic rationality, dispositions, etc.), although it still fosters that style of reasoning.\n  - Quite wordy and multi-part; some students might find the number of sub-questions a bit overwhelming unless guided by an instructor.\n  - Slightly less original/pointed than B\u2019s \u201cPanopticon of Care\u201d / \u201cinteractional obsolescence\u201d framing; more standard but still very good.\n\n\nResponse D:\n- Does well:\n  - Clearly tries to obey the \u201ccouncil\u201d meta-instruction from the broader system, and explicitly references:\n    - The ChatGPT / Perplexity / Gemini styles.\n    - The SEP\u2019s Deweyan phases and Ennis\u2019s dispositions.\n  - The 5 core questions are good, and they map well to the context:\n    - Autonomy & emotional dependency in memory-based, proactive engagement.\n    - Privacy and data ethics for continuous edge processing and recall.\n    - Equity and access given expensive hardware and cultural variation.\n    - Dehumanization vs empathy in simulated emotional responses.\n    - Accountability and bias when misinterpretation leads to harm.\n  - Each question is accompanied by a rationale tying it back to Dewey/Ennis, critical thinking processes, and the technical context. From a pedagogy perspective, this is thoughtful and shows understanding of the SEP article.\n\n- Does poorly:\n  - Includes a long \u201cCouncil Deliberation Report\u201d narrative that the user did not ask for in this specific question. The original prompt here is simply to provide 5 critical thinking questions; the meta-layer is extraneous and may distract from the actual deliverable.\n  - The rationales, while insightful, add substantial verbosity. Instructors might have to strip away the narrative to extract just the questions.\n  - Compared with B and C, the questions themselves are slightly more conventional and less tightly tied to particular screenplays or therapeutic techniques. The real added value is in the rationales, not the questions.\n  - The heavy meta-commentary arguably violates the spirit of \u201cjust give 5 questions,\u201d and does not increase the usefulness of the questions for classroom use as much as B or C\u2019s sharper, more focused formulations.\n\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1.

The questions are tailored specifically to the materials, making them highly suitable for a university-level course that would heavily rely on reading comprehension and synthesis of these specific documents.\n\nResponse C is a strong runner-up. It accurately uses the screenplay details (ROS, Nvidia, specific therapies) and frames them within standard bioethical tensions (Autonomy vs. Beneficence, Privacy, Equity). It is well-structured and comprehensive. However, it integrates the Stanford Philosophy text less deeply than Response B; instead of using the philosophical concepts *within* the questions (like Response B's use of \"epistemic rationality\"), it mostly uses the text as a framing device for the discussion.\n\nResponse D demonstrates a deep understanding of the pedagogical theory in the Stanford text, providing rationales that map the questions to specific critical thinking phases (Dewey) and dispositions (Ennis). However, it wraps the response in a \"Council Deliberation Report\" format where it personifies the AI tools mentioned in the uploaded file (ChatGPT, Perplexity) as \"Council Representatives.\" This is a confusing and unnecessary meta-interpretation of the context.

The questions are thought-provoking and encourage critical thinking by posing trade-offs and requiring justification based on ethical principles like autonomy and justice. They are suitable for a university-level ethics class, as they draw on philosophical concepts (e.g., informed consent, theories of justice) and reference social robots in healthcare, aligning somewhat with the context's focus on older adults and care interactions. The response is concise and directly answers the prompt without unnecessary fluff.\n\n**What it does poorly:** It lacks deep integration with the specific context from the uploaded files, such as the screenplay's emphasis on therapies (e.g., Reminiscence, Validation, CBT), robot capabilities (e.g., body language detection, memory recall), or validation processes. The questions feel somewhat generic and could apply to any AI in healthcare, rather than tailoring to the social care robot's unique features like proactive engagement or facial expressions. It doesn't explicitly reference critical thinking frameworks from the Stanford link (e.g., Dewey's phases or dispositions), missing an opportunity to emphasize reflective processes.\n\n### Evaluation of Response B\n**What it does well:** This response excels in tying questions directly to the screenplay context, referencing specific use cases (e.g., \"Empathetic Listening Glow,\" \"Proactive Engagement Check\") and robot features (e.g., vision-detected cues, memory recall). It grounds questions in ethical frameworks like virtue ethics and autonomy, while prompting critical analysis of AI's implications (e.g., deception, paternalism, privacy). The questions encourage reflective thinking by asking students to weigh moral costs, draw on perspectives, and consider long-term impacts, aligning with the Stanford entry's emphasis on epistemic rationality and open-mindedness. It's focused and suitable for an ethics class, with a clear basis in the provided documents.\n\n**What it does poorly:** The questions are somewhat repetitive in structure (e.g., starting with \"If...\" scenarios) and could be more concise; some feel like mini-essays rather than sharp critical prompts. It doesn't incorporate the broader council deliberation or multiple AI responses from the context, and while it mentions the Stanford link briefly, it doesn't deeply weave in critical thinking components (e.g., hypothesis testing or evidence evaluation) to elevate the questions beyond ethical dilemmas.\n\n### Evaluation of Response C\n**What it does well:** Response C is structured and comprehensive, providing five questions with sub-questions/extensions, key tensions, and a \"Discussion Framework\" that explicitly ties to ethical theories (e.g., deontological vs. utilitarian) and critical thinking hallmarks from the Stanford entry (e.g., applying frameworks, stakeholder perspectives). It references screenplay elements like proactive engagement and validation therapy, making it relevant to the context. The questions promote deep analysis (e.g., liability in AI failures) and are well-suited for university discussion, encouraging distinctions between technical and ethical aspects.\n\n**What it does poorly:** It sometimes overloads questions with multiple sub-parts, which might dilute focus and make them less purely \"critical thinking\" oriented (e.g., resembling debate prompts more than reflective inquiries). The integration with context feels surface-level compared to others (e.g., fewer direct quotes from screenplays), and it doesn't synthesize the different AI responses (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) or emphasize critical thinking dispositions/processes as robustly as possible, potentially missing the deliberative depth from the full context.\n\n### Evaluation of Response D\n**What it does well:** This response stands out for its creative \"Council Deliberation Report\" format, which synthesizes insights from ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini representatives, directly addressing the prompt's instruction to \"use all of this context when addressing the prompt.\" It explicitly ties questions to critical thinking principles from the Stanford entry (e.g., Dewey's phases, Ennis's dispositions) and screenplay details (e.g., \"Memory Recall Spark,\" ROS nodes), while providing rationales and class recommendations. The questions are balanced, open-ended, and foster reflective processes like hypothesis testing and evidence-based judgment, making them highly suitable for a university ethics class focused on AI in healthcare.\n\n**What it does poorly:** The council format adds length and complexity, which might feel overly elaborate or tangential to the core prompt of simply providing 5 questions. While comprehensive, it could be seen as less direct, and some questions repeat themes (e.g., autonomy in Q1 and Q2) without adding novel angles. It assumes familiarity with the context's AI responses, which might not be necessary for the output.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1. Response D\n2. Response B\n3. Response C\n4. Response A",

Drawing directly from the uploaded screenplay scenarios\u2014specifically the use of Validation Therapy, Proactive Engagement, and active listening\u2014and the **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** (SEP) definition of critical thinking as \"careful goal-directed thinking,\" we present the following five questions.\n\nThese questions are designed to move university students beyond knee-jerk reactions, forcing them to exercise specific critical thinking dispositions (e.g., *seeking the truth*, *open-mindedness*) and abilities (*judging*, *deciding*) identified in the philosophical literature.\n\n***\n\n# Critical Thinking Questions: Ethical Implications of AI in Healthcare\n\n### 1. The Ethics of \"Validation\" vs. Epistemic Rationality\n**Context:** The robot screenplay relies heavily on **Validation Therapy** principles (\"Emotion first, facts later\"). For example, if an older adult with cognitive decline believes their deceased parent is coming to visit, the robot is programmed not to correct them but to validate the emotion (e.g., \"You really miss your mother\").\n**Question:** Is it ethically permissible for a social care robot to reinforce a user\u2019s false beliefs to minimize anxiety, or does this constitute a violation of the user's dignity and epistemic rights? If critical thinking involves \"seeking the truth\" (SEP), are we failing vulnerable patients by surrounding them with machines designed to deceive them for their own comfort?\n**Critical Thinking Focus:** *Weighing competing values (Beneficence vs. Truth/Dignity); evaluating the definition of \"harm.\"*\n\n### 2. Algorithmic Paternalism and Proactive Engagement\n**Context:** The design documents describe a \"Proactive Engagement\" feature where the robot utilizes \"situational awareness\" to detect if a human is slumped or silent. It then autonomously decides to initiate conversation or suggest **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** exercises (e.g., deep breathing).\n**Question:** At what point does an AI\u2019s \"proactive support\" become \"paternalistic interference\"? By programming a robot to interpret silence as a problem to be \"solved\" with engagement, are we eroding the user's autonomy to simply be alone or experience negative emotions without technological intervention?\n**Critical Thinking Focus:** *Defining the problem (SEP: \"Intellectualization of the difficulty\"); analyzing the boundary between support and control.*\n\n### 3. The \"Panopticon of Care\": Privacy vs. Contextual Memory\n**Context:** To achieve the goal of a \"trusting companion,\" the robot is built on a stack of **Nvidia hardware and Vision APIs** that continuously process the user's facial expressions, body language (e.g., \"open mouth,\" \"leaning forward\"), and daily history (\"context-specific memory recall\").\n**Question:** The robot is designed to build trust through intimacy, yet intimate knowledge in humans is voluntary, whereas in this robot, it is the result of constant surveillance. How should we ethically weigh the clinical benefits of the robot \"remembering what matters\" against the loss of privacy required to feed its memory banks? Does consent truly exist if the user has cognitive decline?\n**Critical Thinking Focus:** *Judge credibility of consent; analyzing systems and trade-offs.*\n\n### 4. Interactional Obsolescence and Human Virtue\n**Context:** The screenplay demands the robot be a perfect conversationalist: it never interrupts, it uses a visual timer to show it is \"thinking\" so as not to frustrate the user, and it yields the floor immediately upon detecting a gesture. It removes all friction from social interaction.\n**Question:** If we deploy robots that are infinitely patient and friction-free, how might this alter our valuation of human care, which is inherently messy, impatient, and reciprocal? From a **Virtue Ethics** perspective, does outsourcing \"patience\" to complete a task (caregiving) atrophy the moral character of the human society that relies on it?\n**Critical Thinking Focus:** *Forecasting implications (Dewey's \"further conclusions to which it tends\"); appraising arguments regarding social values.*\n\n### 5. Accountability in the \"Loop\" of Care\n**Context:** The prompt notes that the robot uses **Microsoft AI** and edge processing to interpret ambiguous human cues\u2014such as determining if an older adult haltingly saying \"My daughter... uh...\" is a finished thought or a pause.\n**Question:** If the AI misinterprets a sign of genuine medical distress (e.g., a stroke or a fall) as a \"thinking pose\" or a \"behavioral pause\" and simply waits politely as programmed, where does moral and legal responsibility lie? Is it with the engineer who prioritized \"politeness,\" the AI model that misclassified the image, or the healthcare facility that replaced human oversight with a machine?\n**Critical Thinking Focus:** *Identifying and analyzing casual chains; assigning responsibility in complex systems.*"
