How will they be involved?\n    *   **Problem definition:** How does the research address a significant real-world problem or opportunity?\n    *   **Bridging theory and practice:** How will the research contribute to both academic theory and practical application/impact?\n    *   **Research design:** Methods appropriate for engaged research, data collection strategies, and ethical considerations for collaboration.\n    *   **Expected outcomes and impact:** What are the anticipated theoretical and practical contributions?\n    *   **Feasibility and resources:** Practical considerations for conducting engaged research.\n4.  **Require the student to provide their response** for that section after your guidance.\n5.  **Review the student's input** for alignment with engaged scholarship principles and the overall coherence of the proposal. Offer constructive feedback and ask follow-up questions to deepen their thinking and refine their content, pushing them towards a high-quality, advisor-approvable research proposal.\n\nThe process should be iterative, following Van de Ven's systematic approach to construct a clear, well-justified, and impactful engaged scholarship research proposal. Begin by clearly outlining the initial steps or the first section of Van de Ven's framework for developing an engaged scholarship proposal.\n\n## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AND INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThis context was developed through conversation:\n\nuser: I want to focus the example on aging care topics since there are many aspects and issues worth researching as the world ages and people want to age in place and not in nursing homes but there are not enough caregiver to support the growing aging population.\nassistant: That's a very important and timely topic! Focusing on aging care, especially with the \"aging in place\" trend and the caregiver shortage, provides a lot of rich ground for an LLM to explore.\n\nTo help you build a comprehensive context for your LLM prompt, let's think about what kind of information would be most useful. My goal is to make sure the LLM understands the nuances and can generate truly insightful content.\n\nHere are some types of documents and information I think would be super helpful. Could you tell me if you have any of these, or if we should brainstorm ways to create or find them?\n\n1.  **Definitions and Key Terminology:**\n    *   What exactly do you mean by \"aging in place\"? Are there specific services, technologies, or environmental modifications associated with it that you want the LLM to consider?\n    *   How do you define \"caregiver shortage\"? Are we talking about professional caregivers, family caregivers, or both?\n\n2.  **Statistics and Data:**\n    *   **Demographic data:** Population projections for elderly individuals (globally, by region, or specific countries if relevant).\n    *   **Caregiver data:** Numbers on the current and projected shortage of caregivers. Data on the average age of caregivers, burnout rates, etc.\n    *   **\"Aging in Place\" preferences:** Statistics indicating how many seniors prefer to age in place versus institutional care.\n    *   **Economic impact:** Costs of institutional care vs. aging in place, economic burden of caregiving.\n\n3.  **Current Challenges and Problems:**\n    *   **Specific issues related to \"aging in place\":** Lack of accessible housing, affordability of services, social isolation, technological barriers, emergency response.\n    *   **Specific issues related to caregiver shortage:** Low wages, demanding work, lack of training, immigration policies impacting care workers, retention issues.\n    *   **Impact on families/society:** Strain on family caregivers, impact on workforce participation.\n\n4.  **Potential Solutions and Innovations (or areas to explore):**\n    *   **Policy recommendations:** Government initiatives, funding models, caregiver support programs.\n    *   **Technological solutions:** Remote monitoring, AI-powered assistants, telehealth, smart home devices, assistive technology.\n    *   **Community-based initiatives:** Village models, intergenerational programs, volunteer networks.\n    *   **Workforce development:** Training programs, increased wages, better benefits, recruitment strategies.\n    *   **Innovative care models:** Shared living, co-housing for seniors, adult daycare centers.\n\n5.  **Examples and Case Studies:**\n    *   Are there existing successful \"aging in place\" programs or communities you'd like the LLM to be aware of?\n    *   Examples of countries or regions that are effectively tackling the caregiver shortage.\n\n6.  **Constraints or Guardrails for the LLM:**\n    *   Are there certain aspects you *don't* want the LLM to focus on?\n    *   Do you want it to maintain a specific tone (e.g., optimistic, critical, analytical)?\n    *   Should it prioritize certain types of solutions (e.g., technology, policy, community)?\n    *   Any ethical considerations related to technology or care that should be highlighted?\n\nLet's start by thinking about what kind of foundational documents you might have. For instance, do you have any reports, articles, or policy briefs that you find particularly insightful on this topic? Even simple bullet points of your own understanding would be a great start!\nuser: We want the focus to be China both in the urban and rural settings.\nassistant: Excellent! Narrowing the focus to China, specifically urban and rural settings, adds a crucial layer of specificity and complexity. This allows us to get much more targeted with the LLM's output.\n\nNow, with China as the geographic focus, the types of documents and information become even more specific. We'll need to consider the unique socio-economic, cultural, and political context of China.\n\nLet's refine the document types we discussed, tailor-made for China (urban and rural):\n\n1.  **Definitions and Key Terminology (China-Specific):**\n    *   Are there specific Chinese terms or concepts related to \"aging in place\" (e.g., \"\u5c45\u5bb6\u517b\u8001\" - home-based care for the elderly) or elderly care that the LLM should be aware of?\n    *   How is \"caregiver\" defined in China? Distinction between family caregivers, domestic helpers (Ayis), professional care workers, and institutional staff.\n    *   Understanding of the \"one-child policy\" generation's impact on elderly care.\n\n2.  **Statistics and Data (China-Specific):**\n    *   **Demographic data:**\n        *   Current and projected elderly population in China (total, urban, rural breakdown).\n        *   Proportion of elderly living alone, or with adult children.\n        *   Life expectancy trends.\n    *   **Caregiver data:**\n        *   Numbers and projections of professional caregivers in China (urban vs. rural).\n        *   Data on internal migration patterns affecting family caregiving (e.g., adult children moving to cities, leaving elderly in rural areas).\n        *   Compensation, training, and retention rates for caregivers.\n    *   **\"Aging in Place\" preferences in China:** Are these preferences culturally strong? Any regional differences?\n    *   **Economic impact:** Cost of care in China, government spending on elderly care, individual out-of-pocket expenses.\n    *   **\"9073\" model (or similar policies):** The goal of 90% aging at home, 7% in community centers, 3% in institutions.\n\n3.  **Current Challenges and Problems (China-Specific - Urban vs. Rural):**\n    *   **Urban Challenges:**\n        *   High cost of living impacting \"aging in place\" services.\n        *   Lack of suitable housing stock for elderly (e.g., no elevators, small apartments).\n        *   Limited social infrastructure in some new urban developments.\n        *   **Caregiver issues:** Recruitment challenges for professional caregivers in cities, sometimes reliance on migrant workers who face their own issues.\n    *   **Rural Challenges:**\n        *   \"Hollowed-out villages\" due to youth migration, leaving behind \"left-behind elderly\" (\u7559\u5b88\u8001\u4eba).\n        *   Limited access to healthcare facilities and professional care services.\n        *   Poverty among the elderly.\n        *   Lack of basic infrastructure (transport, internet) for technology-enabled \"aging in place.\"\n        *   **Caregiver issues:** Over-reliance on aging spouses or children who may also be elderly, informal care networks struggling.\n    *   **Common Challenges:**\n        *   Gaps in healthcare provision, especially long-term care insurance.\n        *   Digital divide for elderly.\n        *   Cultural pressures on adult children.\n        *   Pension system challenges.\n\n4.  **Potential Solutions and Innovations (China-Specific - Urban vs. Rural):**\n    *   **Government Policies & Initiatives:**\n        *   National and local government policies for elderly care (e.g., \"National Plan for Elderly Healthcare\").\n        *   Subsidies for \"aging in place\" modifications or services.\n        *   Development of elderly care service centers (\u65e5\u95f4\u7167\u6599\u4e2d\u5fc3 - daycare centers).\n        *   Long-term care insurance pilots.\n    *   **Technological Solutions:**\n        *   Specific Chinese tech companies or platforms focusing on elderly care (e.g., smart home devices adapted for Chinese homes, telehealth platforms).\n        *   Use of big data and AI for care coordination.\n    *   **Community-based initiatives:**\n        *   Neighborhood committees' role in elderly care.\n        *   Volunteer programs.\n        *   Intergenerational programs.\n    *   **Workforce Development:**\n        *   Training programs for caregivers in China.\n        *   Efforts to professionalize the care sector.\n    *   **Cultural/Social Aspects:**\n        *   Role of traditional filial piety (\u5b5d\u9053) and its evolution.\n\n5.  **Examples and Case Studies (China-Specific):**\n    *   Successful \"aging in place\" pilot programs in specific Chinese cities or rural areas.\n    *   Innovative community care models that are working.\n    *   Examples of policies that have been effective or failed.\n\n6.  **Constraints or Guardrails for the LLM (China-Specific):**\n    *   Should the LLM acknowledge the political system's role in policy implementation?\n    *   Are there any sensitivities around discussing specific government policies or economic conditions?\n    *   Tone: Should it be objective and analytical, or can it offer prescriptive solutions?\n\nTo get started, do you have any foundational documents like **government reports on elderly care in China (e.g., from the Ministry of Civil Affairs or National Health Commission)**, **academic papers on aging in China**, or **news articles discussing these issues**? Even general knowledge or specific points you'd like to highlight about China's urban and rural aging challenges would be invaluable.\n\n\n---\n\nThe council should use all of this context when addressing the prompt above.

Section title  \n**Section 1: Research Problem and Stakeholder Setting (Problem Formulation in an Engaged Scholarship Context)**\n\n### 2. Purpose of this section (within engaged scholarship)\n\nIn Van de Ven\u2019s engaged scholarship, the *problem formulation* stage is not just \u201cdescribe a gap in the literature.\u201d It should:\n\n- Start from a **significant real-world problem or opportunity**, not only from theory.\n- Be **co-informed by practice communities** (older adults, caregivers, policy makers, providers, etc.), not defined by the academic alone.\n- Explicitly show how the issue is:\n  - **Relevant** (socially, ethically, economically significant in China\u2019s aging context).\n  - **Open** (not already solved in practice or theory).\n  - **Actionable** (there is some realistic possibility of change).\n- Clarify the **stakeholder setting**: who is involved, how they see the problem, and where (urban vs rural China).\n- Begin to hint at how your work could **bridge theory and practice**.\n\nBy the end of this section, a reader (academic or practitioner/policymaker in China) should say:  \n\u201c**Yes, this is an important and well-specified problem worth studying, and I see who cares about it.**\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 3. Actions, guiding questions, and considerations\n\nUse these to draft your Section 1. I\u2019ll ask you to write a draft after reading.\n\n#### 3.1 Clarify the real-world problem (China, aging in place, caregiver shortage)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201cperfect\u201d yet, but you should choose a reasonably specific angle. For example (you can pick something else):\n\n- How urban older adults in high-rise apartments in Beijing/Shanghai/\u2026 struggle to age in place due to fragmented home-care services.  \n- How **left-behind rural elderly (\u7559\u5b88\u8001\u4eba)** cope with aging in place when adult children are migrant workers and there are few formal caregivers.  \n- How technology-enabled services (e.g., telehealth, smart home devices) are or are not actually helping older adults age in place, given digital divides.  \n- How community-based elder care service stations / neighborhood committees manage the gap between policy expectations (e.g., \u201c9073\u201d model) and limited caregiving resources.\n\nGuiding prompts:\n\n- **What concrete situation do you want to focus on?**  \n  - Urban, rural, or explicitly comparing both?  \n  - Which province(s) or type of city/village (e.g., Tier 1 cities vs county-level cities vs remote villages)?\n- **What is happening that makes this a problem?**\n  - For example: lack of trained caregivers; older adults living alone; burden on daughters/daughters-in-law; mismatch between policy (e.g., \u201c\u5c45\u5bb6\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u793e\u533a\u4e3a\u4f9d\u6258\u2026\u201d) and reality; financial strain; low quality of care; social isolation.\n- **What real-world consequences arise?**\n  - For older adults (health, dignity, safety, loneliness).\n  - For family caregivers (burnout, work\u2013family conflict).\n  - For providers (turnover, low morale).\n  - For government/society (costs, inequity between urban and rural, social stability concerns).\n\nTry to ground this description **in China\u2019s context** (e.g., one-child policy legacy, internal migration, 9073 model, filial piety expectations, hukou system).\n\n#### 3.2 Identify and describe key stakeholders\n\nThink broadly about **practice communities** and beneficiaries:\n\n- **Primary beneficiaries / affected groups**\n  - Older adults aging in place:  \n    - Urban: older adults in danwei housing, commercial housing estates, old neighborhoods without elevators, etc.  \n    - Rural: left-behind elderly, \u201cempty-nest\u201d couples, elderly living alone in villages.\n- **Informal caregivers**\n  - Adult children (often living in another city).\n  - Spouses (who may also be elderly).\n  - Other relatives or neighbors.\n- **Formal / semi-formal caregivers and organizations**\n  - Home care workers (\u5bb6\u653f\u670d\u52a1\u5458 / \u62a4\u5de5 / \u517b\u8001\u62a4\u7406\u5458).\n  - Community elder care centers / day care centers (\u793e\u533a\u517b\u8001\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fc3, \u65e5\u95f4\u7167\u6599\u4e2d\u5fc3).\n  - Village doctors and community health centers.\n  - Private eldercare companies / platforms.\n- **Policy and governance actors**\n  - Local Civil Affairs bureaus (\u6c11\u653f\u5c40).\n  - National and local Health Commissions.\n  - Neighborhood/village committees (\u5c45\u59d4\u4f1a / \u6751\u59d4\u4f1a).\n- **Others**\n  - Technology providers (telecare, smart devices, platforms).\n  - NGOs, volunteers, religious/charitable organizations.\n  - Academic researchers, think tanks, training institutions.\n\nGuiding prompts:\n\n- **Who are the 3\u20136 most central stakeholder groups for *your* chosen problem?**\n- **What are their interests and concerns in relation to this problem?**\n- **Where might their perspectives conflict?**\n  - e.g., families wanting affordable care vs private agencies wanting sustainable profits; government wanting high coverage vs limited budgets.\n- **Who might you realistically involve or consult during your PhD?**  \n  - Think about access: which stakeholders can you talk to, partner with, or co-design parts of the research with?\n\n#### 3.3 Connect the problem to theory\u2013practice bridging (at a high level)\n\nYou don\u2019t need a detailed literature review yet, but briefly:\n\n- **Why is this not just a local management issue, but also a theoretical problem?** For example:\n  - It challenges models of intergenerational support, welfare mix, long-term care systems, or technology adoption among older adults.\n  - It raises questions about how community-based service systems actually work under strong state policy guidance (e.g., implementation gaps).\n- **What kinds of scholarly fields might care about this?**\n  - Gerontology, public policy, health services management, social work, organizational studies, technology and society, rural sociology, etc.\n\nThink in terms of **tension or gap** between:\n\n- \u201cHow things are supposed to work\u201d (in policy, theory, or official models); and\n- \u201cHow things actually work\u201d in your chosen Chinese context.\n\n#### 3.4 Initial thoughts on scope (to keep the project feasible)\n\nEngaged scholarship encourages ambition but also realism.\n\nPrompts:\n\n- **Geographic scope:**  \n  - Will you focus on one city and one rural county? One province? A particular type of urban district or rural township?\n- **Level of analysis:**  \n  - Individual older adults and families?  \n  - Community/organizational level (e.g., the functioning of community eldercare centers)?  \n  - Policy implementation at local government level?\n- **Care modality:**  \n  - Purely home-based care? Home + community centers? Integration with hospital/clinic services?\n- **Time frame:**  \n  - Will you primarily collect cross-sectional data or attempt some longitudinal engagement over years?\n\nBeing explicit about what you **will not** cover is also helpful.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Your task now: Draft Section 1\n\nPlease draft **Section 1: Research Problem and Stakeholder Setting**. Use these subheadings (you can adapt wording later for the final proposal):\n\n1. **1.1 Preliminary Problem Statement (200\u2013350 words)**  \n   - Describe:\n     - The specific situation or phenomenon you will focus on in China (urban, rural, or both).\n     - Why it is a serious and timely problem in the context of aging in place and caregiver shortages.\n     - Concrete consequences for key groups (older adults, families, providers, policy system).\n\n2. **1.2 Key Stakeholders and Their Interests (bullet points or short paragraphs)**  \n   - List 3\u20136 main stakeholder groups. For each:\n     - Who they are (briefly).\n     - How they experience or are involved in the problem.\n     - What they likely want or are concerned about in this area.\n\n3. **1.3 Initial Scope and Focus (150\u2013250 words)**  \n   - Indicate:\n     - Urban vs rural scope (and if comparative, how).\n     - The main level(s) of analysis (e.g., households, community eldercare centers, local policy implementation).\n     - What aspects you explicitly plan to include and exclude at this stage.\n   - You can mention that this is provisional and may be refined as you engage with stakeholders.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be \u201cfinal\u201d now. The goal is to get your **best current articulation** on paper so we can refine it.\n\n---\n\n### 5. What I will do next\n\nAfter you post your draft for Section 1:\n\n- I will **review it for alignment with engaged scholarship principles** (relevance, rigor potential, collaboration potential, theory\u2013practice bridging).\n- I\u2019ll **give you constructive feedback**:\n  - Where the problem framing is strong or could be sharper.\n  - Whether stakeholders are well-chosen and clearly connected to the problem.\n  - Suggestions to improve feasibility and clarity.\n- I\u2019ll ask **targeted follow-up questions** to deepen your thinking and then move with you to **Section 2: Purpose, Aims, and Significance**.\n\n---\n\nPlease go ahead and draft:\n\n- **1.1 Preliminary Problem Statement**  \n- **1.2 Key Stakeholders and Their Interests**  \n- **1.3 Initial Scope and Focus**"

You have chosen a topic of profound significance\u2014**aging care in China**\u2014and a methodological framework, **Engaged Scholarship**, that is perfectly suited to address the \"wicked problems\" found at the intersection of demographics, policy, and human need.\n\nAndrew Van de Ven\u2019s framework challenges us not just to study *about* a subject, but to study *with* practitioners to produce knowledge that is scientifically rigorous and practically relevant. We will move beyond merely identifying a \"gap in the literature\" to identifying a \"gap in practice.\"\n\nLet\u2019s begin the process of building your proposal.\n\n***\n\n# Section 1: Problem Formulation \u2013 Grounding the Research in Reality\n\n### 1. Purpose of this Section\nIn traditional scholarship, a research proposal often begins with a theoretical gap. In **Engaged Scholarship**, we begin with a **real-world problem definition**.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to situate your research in the messy, complex reality of the practitioners (the \"problem owners\"). We need to answer the question: *Who cares about this research besides other academics?*\n\nFor your topic on aging in China, we cannot simply state \"there are too many old people and not enough caregivers.\" We must diagnose the specific \"pinch points\" experienced by stakeholders in both urban and rural contexts. Van de Ven refers to this as **Knowledge Arbitrage**\u2014leveraging the unique perspective of practitioners to define the problem accurately.\n\n### 2. Guiding Questions and Considerations\n\nTo draft this section, please address the following points using the specific context of China\u2019s aging population:\n\n**A. Identify the Problem Owners (Stakeholders)**\n*   **Who are they?** Be specific. Are you looking at the Ministry of Civil Affairs (policymakers)? The adult children of the \"One-Child\" generation (family caregivers)? The \"Ayis\" (domestic helpers) in cities? The village committees in rural \"hollowed-out\" villages?\n*   **Engagement Strategy:** How would you theoretically interact with them to confirm this is a real problem? (e.g., \"I need to talk to nursing home directors in Shanghai to understand why staff turnover is high,\" or \"I need to look at rural healthcare access data.\")\n\n**B. Diagnosis of the Problem (The \"Pinch\")**\n*   **The Urban/Rural Divide:** How does the \"caregiver shortage\" manifest differently in these two settings?\n    *   *Hint:* In urban areas, is it a cost/labor market issue (migrant workers)? In rural areas, is it a demography issue (all the youth have left)?\n*   **The \"9073\" Context:** China aims for 90% home-based care. Why is this failing or struggling? Is it the built environment (no elevators in old apartments)? Is it the burnout of family members?\n\n**C. Magnitude and Urgency**\n*   Use the data context we discussed. Why is this a crisis *now*? (e.g., The retirement of the baby boomer cohort, the shrinking workforce).\n\n### 3. Your Action Plan\n\n**Please write a designated \"Problem Statement\" (approx. 300-500 words) for your proposal.**\n\nDo not simply list statistics. Narrative the *conflict*. For example: *\"While government policy dictates 90% of seniors should age in place, the one-child policy has decimated the family structure required to support this, creating a reliance on a professional caregiving workforce that does not yet exist in sufficient numbers.\"*\n\n**> Please provide your Problem Statement below.**"

            "response": "# Welcome to Your Engaged Scholarship Research Proposal Development Journey\n\n## Introduction to the Process\n\nWelcome! I'm delighted to guide you through developing a comprehensive engaged scholarship research proposal focused on aging care in China. This is a critically important topic with profound implications for both urban and rural communities as China faces rapid demographic shifts.\n\nBased on Andrew Van de Ven's *Engaged Scholarship* framework, we will work through this proposal systematically, section by section. This approach emphasizes creating research that is **rigorous, relevant, and impactful** by actively engaging stakeholders throughout the research process. Your research will bridge academic theory with practical solutions that can make a real difference for China's aging population and their caregivers.\n\nBefore we dive into the first formal section, let me outline the overall structure we'll follow:\n\n### The Engaged Scholarship Proposal Framework\n\nWe will develop your proposal through these key components:\n\n1. **Problem Formulation** (where we'll start today)\n2. **Theoretical Grounding and Knowledge Gaps**\n3. **Stakeholder Identification and Engagement Strategy**\n4. **Research Questions**\n5. **Research Design and Methods**\n6. **Expected Contributions (Theoretical and Practical)**\n7. **Feasibility, Resources, and Timeline**\n8. **Ethical Considerations**\n9. **Impact Pathway and Dissemination Strategy**\n\nNow, let's begin with the foundational element of your proposal.\n\n---\n\n# SECTION 1: PROBLEM FORMULATION\n\n## Purpose of This Section\n\nIn engaged scholarship, **problem formulation** is fundamentally different from traditional research. Rather than identifying a purely theoretical gap, you must articulate a **real-world problem or opportunity** that matters to multiple stakeholders\u2014both practitioners and scholars. \n\nThis section serves several critical purposes:\n- Establishes the **practical significance** of your research\n- Demonstrates that the problem is **consequential** for real communities and organizations\n- Shows **who cares** about this problem and why\n- Sets the foundation for stakeholder engagement\n- Connects practical problems to theoretical opportunities\n\nFor your research on aging care in China, this means clearly articulating the challenges facing elderly individuals, their families, caregivers, communities, and policymakers in both urban and rural contexts.\n\n## Guiding Questions and Concrete Actions\n\nTo develop a robust problem formulation, please address the following:\n\n### 1. **The Real-World Problem**\n\n**Primary Questions:**\n- What is the specific, tangible problem related to aging care in China that your research will address?\n- How does this problem manifest differently in **urban versus rural settings**?\n- What are the consequences if this problem remains unaddressed?\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Think beyond statistics to real human experiences\n- Consider the \"left-behind elderly\" (\u7559\u5b88\u8001\u4eba) in rural areas\n- Consider urban challenges like housing, cost, and service access\n- How does the one-child policy generation affect this problem?\n- What role does the caregiver shortage play?\n\n### 2. **Who Experiences This Problem?**\n\n**Key Questions:**\n- Who are the primary stakeholders affected by this problem?\n  - Elderly individuals themselves?\n  - Family caregivers (adult children, spouses)?\n  - Professional caregivers?\n  - Community organizations?\n  - Local or national government agencies?\n  - Healthcare providers?\n- How do different stakeholder groups experience the problem differently?\n\n### 3. **Current Attempts and Their Limitations**\n\n**Reflection Points:**\n- What solutions are currently being tried? (Consider the \"9073\" model: 90% aging at home, 7% in community centers, 3% in institutions)\n- Why are current approaches insufficient?\n- What gaps exist in policy, services, technology, or community support?\n\n### 4. **Significance and Urgency**\n\n**Critical Questions:**\n- Why does this problem matter **now**?\n- What demographic, social, or economic trends make this urgent?\n- What are the scale and scope of impact?\n- How does this connect to broader societal challenges in China?\n\n### 5. **Initial Theoretical Connections**\n\n**Bridging to Academia:**\n- What academic disciplines or theoretical perspectives might help explain or address this problem? (e.g., gerontology, public health, social policy, urban-rural studies, technology adoption, sociology of care)\n- What don't we understand theoretically about this problem?\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nPlease provide a detailed response addressing the above questions. Aim for **2-3 pages** that:\n\n1. Clearly articulates the specific problem your research will address\n2. Describes how this problem manifests in both urban and rural China\n3. Identifies who is affected and how\n4. Explains why existing solutions are inadequate\n5. Makes a compelling case for why this research matters now\n6. Begins to hint at theoretical dimensions worth exploring\n\n**Write as if you're explaining this problem to both:**\n- An academic committee that values theoretical contribution\n- A Chinese government official or NGO leader who needs to understand real-world impact\n\n---\n\nI'll wait for your response before providing feedback and moving to the next section. Take your time to think deeply about these questions. Remember: in engaged scholarship, **how you frame the problem determines everything that follows**.\n\nPlease share your problem formulation when you're ready."

            "response": "Below is my guidance as an expert academic advisor specializing in engaged scholarship. I'll draw on Andrew Van de Ven's framework from his book *Engaged Scholarship: A Guide for Organizational and Social Research* (2007) to help you, as a PhD student, develop a comprehensive research proposal. Van de Ven's approach emphasizes a \"diamond model\" for engaged scholarship, which bridges the gap between theory and practice through collaboration with stakeholders. The model consists of four interconnected phases:\n\n1. **Problem Formulation** (grounding the research in a real-world issue).\n2. **Theory Building** (developing or applying theoretical models to explain the problem).\n3. **Research Design** (planning methods for empirical inquiry).\n4. **Problem Solving and Communication** (applying findings for impact and disseminating knowledge).\n\nThis iterative process ensures relevance (addressing practical problems), rigor (sound academic methods), impact (actionable outcomes), and collaboration (involving practitioners and stakeholders). We'll build your proposal section by section, starting with the first one today. For each section, I'll provide targeted guidance, then ask you to respond with your draft content. Once you do, I'll review it for alignment with engaged scholarship principles, offer feedback, and proceed to the next section (or refine the current one if needed).\n\nYour research topic, based on our context, will focus on aging care in China\u2014specifically the challenges and opportunities for \"aging in place\" (e.g., \u5c45\u5bb6\u517b\u8001 or home-based elderly care) amid a growing elderly population and caregiver shortages in urban and rural settings. This is a timely, impactful area, influenced by factors like China's \"9073\" elderly care model (90% at home, 7% in communities, 3% in institutions), demographic shifts from the one-child policy, urban-rural divides (e.g., \"left-behind elderly\" in rural areas), and innovations in policy, technology, and community support. We'll tailor the prompts to this topic while keeping them adaptable.\n\nLet's begin with the first section of Van de Ven's framework.\n\n### Section 1: Problem Formulation\n#### Purpose in Engaged Scholarship Context\nIn Van de Ven's model, Problem Formulation is the foundational step where you identify and articulate a significant real-world problem or opportunity, grounded in the experiences of practitioners and stakeholders. This section ensures relevance by focusing on issues that matter to practice communities (e.g., elderly individuals, caregivers, policymakers in China), while setting the stage for rigor by justifying why the problem warrants scholarly attention. It emphasizes collaboration from the outset\u2014engaging stakeholders to co-define the problem avoids academic silos and bridges theory-practice gaps. Key principles here include: \n- **Relevance**: Addressing pressing societal issues like China's aging population (projected to reach 400 million elderly by 2050) and caregiver shortages (e.g., only ~10 million professional caregivers for ~250 million elderly, with rural-urban disparities).\n- **Impact**: Highlighting how solving this could lead to practical benefits, such as better policies for aging in place.\n- **Collaboration**: Involving diverse voices to ensure the problem is not just academically interesting but practically solvable.\n\nThis section typically includes a problem statement, its context, significance, and initial stakeholder mapping, laying the groundwork for the rest of the proposal.\n\n#### Concrete Actions, Guiding Questions, and Considerations\nTo develop this section, take these steps:\n- **Review literature and data**: Start by synthesizing key statistics and challenges from sources like China's National Bureau of Statistics (e.g., elderly population growth: 18% urban vs. 22% rural elderly by 2030), Ministry of Civil Affairs reports on the \"9073\" model, and academic papers on caregiver shortages (e.g., rural \"hollowed-out villages\" due to migration). Identify gaps, such as limited access to affordable home modifications in urban high-rises or healthcare in rural areas.\n- **Engage stakeholders early**: Map out who to involve (e.g., via interviews or workshops) and how this will shape your problem definition.\n- **Draft iteratively**: Write a 1-2 page section with a clear problem statement, supported by evidence.\n\nAddress these elements explicitly in your response:\n- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Who are the relevant practice communities or beneficiaries (e.g., elderly residents in urban Beijing vs. rural Sichuan, family caregivers, professional \"Ayis\" or care workers, government officials from the National Health Commission, tech firms like Alibaba offering smart home devices)? How will they be involved (e.g., co-defining the problem through participatory workshops or surveys)? Consider urban-rural differences: Urban stakeholders might prioritize tech integration, while rural ones focus on basic infrastructure.\n- **Problem Definition**: How does your research address a significant real-world problem or opportunity? For example, frame it around the caregiver shortage exacerbating barriers to aging in place in China\u2014e.g., urban elderly facing high costs and isolation, rural elderly dealing with migration-induced family caregiver gaps. What data supports its urgency (e.g., burnout rates among caregivers: ~50% in urban settings; economic costs: elderly care market projected at 10 trillion RMB by 2030)?\n- **Bridging Theory and Practice**: How will this problem formulation set up contributions to academic theory (e.g., advancing theories of social capital in aging) and practical application (e.g., informing policies like long-term care insurance pilots)?\n- **Research Design Teaser**: Briefly note how engaged methods (e.g., action research with communities) will fit, including ethical considerations like informed consent for vulnerable elderly participants.\n- **Expected Outcomes and Impact**: What preliminary outcomes do you anticipate (e.g., theoretical insights into urban-rural care disparities; practical recommendations for community-based caregiver training)?\n- **Feasibility and Resources**: What practical considerations apply (e.g., access to rural sites via partnerships with local neighborhood committees; budget for translation or travel; ethical approvals from institutional review boards in China)?\n\nGuiding questions to deepen your thinking:\n- Why is this problem \"engaged\"? How does it reflect stakeholder needs rather than just academic curiosity?\n- What urban-rural contrasts make this problem unique to China (e.g., digital divide in rural areas limiting telehealth)?\n- How might cultural factors like filial piety (\u5b5d\u9053) influence the problem and stakeholder involvement?\n\nNow, provide your draft for this section (aim for 500-800 words). Be specific to aging care in China, and ensure it's justified with evidence. Once you respond, I'll review it for alignment with engaged scholarship (e.g., is it collaborative and impactful?) and provide feedback."

asks what will *not* be covered).\n- Provides a **very usable writing scaffold**: 1.1 Problem Statement, 1.2 Stakeholders, 1.3 Scope & Focus, with word-count guidance.\n- Explicitly describes the **iterative process**: after student\u2019s draft, the advisor will review for engaged scholarship alignment, give feedback, and move to Section 2.\n\nDoes poorly:\n- For this first section, it does **not explicitly prompt** the student to think about **research design** or **expected outcomes/impact**, even at a high level, although those are requested themes in the user\u2019s instructions \u201cfor each section.\u201d It keeps those topics for later sections, which is pedagogically reasonable but technically deviates from the brief.\n- While it hints at feasibility (via scope), it doesn\u2019t explicitly frame feasibility in terms of **resources, access, and constraints** as one of the six bullet themes, though it partially covers it.\n- It slightly re-labels Van de Ven\u2019s framework into seven proposal elements; this is fine, but it\u2019s not explicitly anchored to the \u201cdiamond model\u201d phases.\n\n---\n\nResponse B:\n\nDoes well:\n- Correctly starts with **problem formulation** and contrasts engaged scholarship with traditional \u201cgap in the literature\u201d framing.\n- Emphasizes the idea of **problem owners** and \u201cwho cares besides academics,\u201d which is central to engaged scholarship.\n- Gives some **China-specific context**: mentions 9073 policy, one-child policy generation, migrant workers, urban vs rural issues, and caregiver shortage.\n- Provides concrete guiding questions on:\n  - **Stakeholders** (problem owners: policymakers, adult children, Ayis, village committees).\n  - **Diagnosis of the problem** (urban/rural divide, why 9073 may be struggling).\n  - **Magnitude and urgency** (why this is a crisis now).\n- Requires the student to **write a problem statement** of 300\u2013500 words and gives a stylistic hint (narrativizing conflict rather than just listing stats).\n\nDoes poorly:\n- Does **not outline an overall roadmap** of the full proposal or Van de Ven\u2019s subsequent phases/sections; it jumps straight into one section.\n- The treatment of engaged scholarship is **thin**: it mentions problem owners and knowledge arbitrage but does not systematically link to Van de Ven\u2019s phases or core principles beyond that.\n- It only partially covers the six mandated prompt dimensions:\n  - Has **stakeholder engagement** and **problem definition**.\n  - Very little on **bridging theory and practice**.\n  - No guidance on **research design**, **expected outcomes and impact**, or **feasibility and resources** for this (or any) section.\n- It doesn\u2019t **explicitly commit** to reviewing the student\u2019s draft, offering detailed feedback, or iterating section by section; it just asks for a problem statement.\n- The guidance is comparatively **short and under-specified** for a PhD-level proposal in engaged scholarship.\n\n---\n\nResponse C:\n\nDoes well:\n- Provides a warm but focused introduction that orients the student to **engaged scholarship\u2019s goals**: relevance, rigor, impact, and stakeholder engagement.\n- Lays out a fairly comprehensive **proposal framework** with nine components (problem formulation, theoretical grounding, stakeholder engagement strategy, research questions, design, contributions, feasibility, ethics, impact/dissemination), which gives the student a useful global picture.\n- The explanation of the **purpose of problem formulation** is on point: real-world problem, multiple stakeholders, and theory\u2013practice linkage.\n- Offers structured **guiding questions** under:\n  - Real-world problem (with urban vs rural, left-behind elderly, one-child policy, caregiver shortage).\n  - Who experiences the problem (stakeholders and differentiated experiences).\n  - Current attempts and limitations (9073 model, gaps in policy/services/tech).\n  - Significance and urgency.\n  - Initial theoretical connections (disciplines, theoretical gaps).\n- Asks for a **substantive response** (2\u20133 pages) that addresses both academic and practitioner audiences and lists clear content expectations (urban/rural manifestation, who is affected, why current solutions are insufficient, why it matters now, and hints at theory).\n- States that after the student responds, the advisor will provide **feedback and move to the next section**, satisfying the iterative requirement.\n\nDoes poorly:\n- While strong on problem definition, stakeholders, significance, and some theory\u2013practice bridging, it **omits explicit prompts** on:\n  - **Research design** (methods, data, engaged approaches),\n  - **Expected outcomes and impact**,\n  - **Feasibility and resources**\n  for this section, despite the user\u2019s instruction that each section\u2019s prompts should direct attention to these themes.\n- The China-specific tailoring is **lighter** than in Response A and D: it references left-behind elderly, 9073, and one-child policy but doesn\u2019t provide the more granular, concrete examples (e.g., danwei housing, resident committees, specific organizations).\n- It does not give a clear **sub-structure or headings** for the student\u2019s written Section 1 (compared to Response A\u2019s 1.1/1.2/1.3 structure), which might make drafting less guided.\n- It references Van de Ven in general but does not explicitly anchor the process in his **diamond model phases**, which could be a missed opportunity for conceptual alignment.\n\n---\n\nResponse D:\n\nDoes well:\n- Correctly introduces Van de Ven\u2019s **diamond model** with four phases: problem formulation, theory building, research design, and problem solving/communication, thereby grounding the process clearly in the original framework.\n- Explicitly states that the process will be **iterative**, with the advisor reviewing each section for alignment with engaged scholarship and then moving on or refining as needed.\n- Clearly defines **Section 1: Problem Formulation**, and explains its purpose in engaged scholarship terms: grounding in real-world issues, relevance, impact, and collaboration with stakeholders.\n- Strongly contextualizes the topic in **China\u2019s aging and care landscape** (aging in place, 9073 model, one-child policy legacy, left-behind elderly, urban-rural disparities, tech and policy innovations).\n- Importantly, it **explicitly organizes the prompts** for this section around all six dimensions the user requested:\n  - **Stakeholder engagement** (identify practice communities, how to involve them).\n  - **Problem definition** (real-world aging-in-place and caregiver shortage issues, supported by data).\n  - **Bridging theory and practice** (how this sets up theoretical and practical contributions).\n  - **Research design teaser** (initial thoughts on engaged methods, ethics).\n  - **Expected outcomes and impact** (preliminary contributions to theory and practice).\n  - **Feasibility and resources** (access, partnerships, funding, ethics).\n- Provides **guiding questions** that highlight why this is an engaged problem, how China\u2019s urban-rural contrasts matter, and how cultural factors like filial piety influence both the problem and engagement.\n- Requires the student to draft a **500\u2013800 word section** and explicitly promises to **review it for alignment** with engaged scholarship and provide feedback.\n\nDoes poorly:\n- While it references the four diamond model phases, it doesn\u2019t clearly **lay out how these phases will be translated into concrete proposal sections beyond Section 1**, unlike Response A\u2019s explicit 7-part roadmap.\n- In the \u201cConcrete Actions\u201d part, it blends what might be considered **section-specific content** with more general proposal elements; for Section 1, it may be somewhat ambitious to expect detailed attention to research design, outcomes, and feasibility, though that\u2019s consistent with the user\u2019s instructions.\n- Compared with Response A, its **task structure for writing** is more open-ended (a single 500\u2013800 word draft) and gives fewer internal subheadings or scaffolding, which might be less supportive for some students.\n- Some of the example statistics are asserted in passing and might be **approximate rather than carefully sourced**, but that\u2019s a minor issue in the context of process guidance.\n\n---\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1.

student a comprehensive view of what's ahead\n- **Highly actionable and specific**: Offers concrete subheadings (1.1, 1.2, 1.3) with word counts, making expectations crystal clear\n- **Strong China-specific guidance**: Integrates Chinese terminology (\u7559\u5b88\u8001\u4eba, \u5c45\u5bb6\u517b\u8001, 9073 model) naturally and prompts consideration of context-specific factors like hukou system and filial piety\n- **Practical feasibility focus**: Explicitly asks students to consider what they will NOT cover, helping scope management\n- **Iterative feedback promise**: Clearly states what the advisor will do next with the student's draft\n- **Well-balanced prompts**: Questions span from broad conceptual issues to specific implementation details\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Less explicit Van de Ven framework citation**: While it follows engaged scholarship principles, it doesn't explicitly reference Van de Ven's \"diamond model\" or specific terminology from the book\n- **Could strengthen theory-practice bridging**: Section 3.3 on theoretical connections is relatively brief compared to other elements\n- **Limited on methods preview**: Less guidance on how engaged research methods will specifically shape problem formulation\n\n## Response B\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Compelling narrative voice**: Uses evocative language (\"wicked problems,\" \"pinch points\") that makes engaged scholarship principles memorable\n- **Strong conceptual grounding**: Explicitly introduces \"Knowledge Arbitrage\" as a Van de Ven concept, demonstrating deep framework knowledge\n- **Emphasis on diagnosis over description**: The instruction to \"narrative the conflict\" rather than \"list statistics\" is excellent pedagogical guidance\n- **Clear contrast with traditional scholarship**: Effectively explains why engaged scholarship differs (gap in practice vs. gap in literature)\n- **Provocative questioning**: Questions like \"Who cares about this research besides other academics?\" are powerful framing devices\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Less structured output requirements**: Asks for a 300-500 word problem statement without clear subheadings, which may result in less organized student responses\n- **Incomplete section coverage**: Focuses primarily on problem definition but doesn't equally address stakeholder mapping, scope, or feasibility in Section 1\n- **Less comprehensive stakeholder guidance**: While it mentions various stakeholders, it doesn't provide as systematic a framework for analyzing their interests and conflicts\n- **Missing the iterative review promise**: Doesn't explicitly state what feedback process will follow\n\n## Response C\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Comprehensive framework overview**: Provides a complete 9-section proposal structure upfront, giving excellent big-picture orientation\n- **Balanced dual-audience framing**: The instruction to write for both academic committees and government officials perfectly captures engaged scholarship's dual purpose\n- **Systematic stakeholder analysis**: Section 2 provides thorough guidance on identifying and understanding different stakeholder perspectives\n- **Strong on current solutions critique**: Section 3 explicitly asks students to analyze why existing approaches fail, which is crucial for engaged scholarship\n- **Clear length and formatting expectations**: 2-3 page guidance with specific content requirements\n- **Excellent theoretical bridging**: Section 5 asks students to identify multiple disciplines and theoretical gaps\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Less China-specific terminology**: While it mentions Chinese concepts, it doesn't integrate them as seamlessly as Response A\n- **Potentially overwhelming**: The 5-subsection breakdown with multiple questions per subsection might be too much for initial problem formulation\n- **Van de Ven framework less explicit**: Mentions the book but doesn't detail specific models like the diamond framework\n- **Weaker on methods preview**: Limited guidance on how research design considerations should inform problem formulation\n\n## Response D\n\n**Strengths:**\n- **Most explicit Van de Ven framework explanation**: Clearly articulates the \"diamond model\" with its four phases, providing strong theoretical grounding\n- **Comprehensive integration of context**: Weaves in specific Chinese statistics (400 million elderly by 2050, 10 million caregivers, \"9073\" model) throughout\n- **Detailed stakeholder examples**: Provides concrete examples like \"elderly residents in urban Beijing vs. rural Sichuan\" and \"tech firms like Alibaba\"\n- **Strongest on feasibility**: Explicitly addresses practical considerations like IRB approvals, translation costs, and community partnerships\n- **Holistic element coverage**: Addresses all six dimensions (stakeholder engagement, problem definition, theory-practice bridging, research design, outcomes, feasibility) systematically\n- **Cultural sensitivity**: Mentions filial piety and urban-rural digital divide\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- **Extremely dense and lengthy**: At approximately 1,000+ words before even asking for student input, it may overwhelm rather than guide\n- **Less clear output structure**: Word count guidance (500-800 words) provided but less specific about required subheadings or organizational framework\n- **Could be more conversational**: More academic/formal tone than the advisory, mentoring voice expected in engaged scholarship\n- **Delayed action**: Takes longer to get to the actual student task compared to other

It starts by outlining an overall roadmap adapted from Van de Ven's framework, which helps set the stage iteratively, and then dives deeply into the first section (Research Problem & Stakeholder Setting). The explanation of the section's purpose emphasizes key principles like relevance, rigor, and collaboration. It offers detailed concrete actions, guiding questions, and considerations that explicitly cover stakeholder engagement, problem definition, bridging theory and practice, and feasibility (with some nods to research design and outcomes). It effectively incorporates the China-specific context (e.g., urban-rural divides, \"9073\" model, filial piety). It requires a specific student draft with subheadings and plans for review/feedback, making it iterative. What it does poorly is that the roadmap is \"adapted\" rather than directly quoting Van de Ven's exact phases (e.g., it expands to 7 elements, which could dilute fidelity), and it might overwhelm with length and detail, potentially making it less accessible for a student starting out.\n\n### Evaluation of Response B\nResponse B does well in adopting an engaging, advisor-like tone and focusing on the first section (Problem Formulation) with a clear purpose explanation that highlights engaged scholarship principles like knowledge arbitrage and bridging gaps. It ties in China-specific context (e.g., \"9073\" model, one-child policy) and provides guiding questions on stakeholders, problem diagnosis, and urgency, which touch on problem definition and stakeholder engagement. It requires a student response (a 300-500 word Problem Statement), setting up for iteration. What it does poorly is that it lacks an overall framework outline at the start, as required by the prompt, and its guiding questions are less comprehensive\u2014they do not explicitly direct to bridging theory and practice, research design, expected outcomes, or feasibility/resources. The actions/considerations are somewhat high-level and narrative-focused, without the depth or structure (e.g., no subheadings or iterative feedback plan), making it feel incomplete compared to the prompt's systematic demands.\n\n### Evaluation of Response C\nResponse C does well in being welcoming and motivational, providing an overall framework outline (which helps with initial steps) and starting with the first section (Problem Formulation). The purpose explanation covers relevance, impact, and collaboration, and the guiding questions address problem definition, stakeholders, significance, and initial theoretical connections, with good integration of China context (e.g., \"left-behind elderly,\" \"9073\" model). It requires a detailed student response (2-3 pages) and mentions waiting for feedback, supporting iteration. What it does poorly is that the outlined framework deviates from Van de Ven's exact model (e.g., it includes 9 components like \"Ethical Considerations\" and \"Impact Pathway\" as separate sections, rather than the core diamond model phases), which could mislead on fidelity. It does not explicitly cover all required directs in considerations (e.g., minimal on research design, expected outcomes, feasibility/resources, or ethical considerations for collaboration), and the task asks for an overly lengthy response (2-3 pages) without structured subheadings, potentially skipping the sectional build-out.\n\n### Evaluation of Response D\nResponse D does well in accurately representing Van de Ven's \"diamond model\" with its four phases, providing a clear outline at the start and tailoring it to the aging care in China context (e.g., \"9073\" model, urban-rural disparities, filial piety). It explains the purpose of the first section (Problem Formulation) with emphasis on relevance, rigor, impact, and collaboration. The concrete actions and guiding questions explicitly address all required elements (stakeholder engagement, problem definition, bridging theory/practice, research design teaser, expected outcomes, feasibility/resources), supported by evidence and prompts. It requires a specific draft (500-800 words) and plans for review/feedback with follow-ups, ensuring an iterative process. What it does poorly is that while it incorporates context, it could delve deeper into urban-rural specifics (less detailed than A in examples), and the word count for the student task is on the higher side, which might intimidate without subheadings for structure.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1.

          "response": "Hello! I am delighted to serve as your academic advisor. You have chosen a topic of profound significance\u2014**aging care in China**\u2014and a methodological framework, Andrew Van de Ven\u2019s **Engaged Scholarship**, that is perfectly suited to address \"wicked problems\" found at the intersection of demographics, policy, and human need.\n\nVan de Ven\u2019s framework challenges us not just to study *about* a subject, but to study *with* practitioners to produce knowledge that is scientifically rigorous and practically relevant. We will move beyond identifying a simple \"gap in the literature\" to diagnosing a \"gap in practice.\"\n\n### The Roadmap: The Diamond Model\n\nWe will build your research proposal iteratively, following the four phases of Van de Ven\u2019s **Diamond Model of Engaged Scholarship**:\n\n1.  **Problem Formulation:** Grounding the research in a complex, real-world reality (urban vs. rural contexts).\n2.  **Theory Building:** Developing models to explain the problem using relevant academic disciplines.\n3.  **Research Design:** Creating a method to study the problem *with* stakeholders.\n4.  **Problem Solving:** Communicating findings to create impact for both science and practice.\n\nWe begin today with **Phase 1**.\n\n---\n\n# SECTION 1: PROBLEM FORMULATION\n\n### 1. Purpose of this Section\nIn traditional scholarship, a research proposal often begins with a theoretical anomaly. In **Engaged Scholarship**, we begin with a **real-world problem definition**.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to situate your research in the messy, complex reality of the practitioners (the \"problem owners\"). We need to answer the question: *Who cares about this research besides other academics?*\n\nFor your topic on aging in China, we cannot simply state \"there are too many old people and not enough caregivers.\" We must diagnose the specific \"pinch points\" experienced by stakeholders, leveraging their unique perspectives to define the problem accurately.\n\n### 2. Guiding Actions and Considerations\nTo help you draft this section, please consider the following dimensions. You do not need to answer these as a list, but use them to shape your draft.\n\n*   **Stakeholder Engagement (The \"Problem Owners\"):**\n    *   **Urban:** Think about the \"sandwich generation\" dealing with parents in old walk-up apartments (no elevators) or relying on domestic helpers (*Ayis*) who lack geriatric training.\n    *   **Rural:** Consider the \"left-behind elderly\" (*\u7559\u5b88\u8001\u4eba*) whose adult children have migrated to cities. Who cares for them? The village committee (*minda* or *cunweihui*)? Aging spouses?\n    *   **Systemic:** How does the \"9073\" model (90% home, 7% community, 3% institution) shape their reality? Who is struggling to meet these targets?\n\n*   **Problem Definition (The \"Pinch\"):**\n    *   Where is the conflict? Is it the mismatch between the cultural expectation of filial piety (*Xiao*) and the economic reality of the one-child policy generation?\n    *   Is it the lack of professional status and low pay for caregivers causing high turnover?\n\n*   **Bridging Theory and Practice:**\n    *   How does this practical problem suggest a gap in our understanding? specific theories (e.g., social exchange theory, welfare state implementation) might fail to explain the current Chinese context?\n\n*   **Research Design Teaser:**\n    *   How might you gain access to these stakeholders? (e.g., partnering with a specific community center in Shanghai or a rural township government).\n    *   **Ethical Check:** Working with vulnerable elderly populations requires building deep trust.\n\n*   **Feasibility and Resources:**\n    *   Narrow your scope. You likely cannot study \"all of China.\" Will you compare one specific Tier-1 city district against one specific rural county?\n\n### 3. Your Task: Draft Section 1\n\nPlease draft **Section 1: Problem Formulation** for your proposal. To keep this manageable and structured, please use the following subheadings (approx. 300\u2013500 words total):\n\n1.  **1.1 Preliminary Problem Statement:**\n    *   Describe the specific real-world phenomenon you are focusing on. Contrast the urban and rural manifestations of the \"aging in place\" and caregiver shortage crisis. Use data/context (e.g., demographics, 9073 policy) to establish urgency.\n2.  **1.2 Key Stakeholders and Their Interests:**\n    *   List 3\u20134 specific stakeholder groups (e.g., family members, local civil affairs bureaus, private care agencies). What is *their* specific pain point?\n3.  **1.3 Initial Scope and Focus:**\n    *   define your boundary. Where will you look? (e.g., \"A comparative study of home-care resource allocation in [Urban City] and [Rural County].\")\n\n**Please provide your draft below.** Once you submit, I will review it for alignment with engaged scholarship principles (relevance, rigor, impact) and provide feedback to refine it before we move to Theory Building."
