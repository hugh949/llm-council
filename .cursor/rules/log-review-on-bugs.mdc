# Log Review on Bugs and Issues

When the user reports a bug, issue, or unexpected behavior:

1. **Ask for or capture logs** – Request Azure log output if available, or run `./scripts/review-logs.sh capture 60`.
2. **Review logs before proposing fixes** – Use `./scripts/review-logs.sh review <file>` to surface errors, warnings, council flow. Let log findings inform the fix.
3. **Add logging if needed** – If the root cause was hard to trace, add or adjust `log_api()` in `backend/main.py`.

See REQUIREMENTS.md §7 and docs/LOGS.md for full workflow.
